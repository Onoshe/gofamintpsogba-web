George), a member of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) and a dynamic leader of the Christ Army Band of the CAC then at 83, Lagos Street, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, who had always felt a deep conviction of the call of God on his life.Thus in 1956, they started first as a small fellowship and Bible Study Group led by Brother R.A.George at his residence at No 9, Omotola Street, IwayaYaba, Lagos. The fellowship group then included the late Sister Dupe George, Brothers David Akinremi, Meshack Akinola, Iwaku J. Bagere, Daniel Aluko, Olusegun George, Elijah Oludele Abina, and Elkanah Obideyi. The other members of the group were Brothers Solomon Kudoro, Richard Godonu Akapo, one Mrs. Dorcas Adeyemi, Sisters Mary Kudoro, Felicia Akinremi (later Matron Felicia Abina), Janet Oke, Dupe Oju (later Dupe Akapo), among others.",

Pastor George was ordained as Pastor in 1959 and he transited into glory in 1987 after which his deputy all along at the time, Pastor (Dr) E.O.
