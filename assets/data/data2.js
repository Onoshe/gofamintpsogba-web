It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be  evangelists, ' 
     +'and some to be pastors and teachers, to prepare God’s people for works  of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up. (Eph. 4:11-22).

Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of  others. But made himself nothing taking '

Let  no foul or polluting language, nor evil word, nor unwholesome or worthless talk (ever)  come out of your mouth; but only such (speech) as is good and beneficial to the  spiritual progress of others, 
    as is fitting to the need and the occasion, that it may be a  blessing and give (God’s favour) to those who hear it. (Eph. 4:29). Obey your leaders  and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an  account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be no  advantage to you. (Heb. 13:17).
