      "message": "This verse from the book of Daniel offers us a glimpse into the transformative power of truly knowing God. It invites us to delve deeper into what it means to have an intimate relationship with the Divine and how it impacts our lives. So let us embark on this spiritual journey together, seeking wisdom and revelation from the Holy Scriptures. |I. Understanding the Nature of Knowing God: A. Knowing God is more than just an intellectual pursuit; it is a personal and intimate relationship. It involves experiencing God's presence, understanding His character, and aligning our will with His. B. The journey of knowing God starts with acknowledgment and recognition of His existence and sovereignty. As we delve deeper into His Word and spend time in prayer and meditation, our understanding of Him grows. C. Knowing God requires faith and trust. It's about surrendering our lives to Him, believing in His promises, and walking in obedience to His will. |II. The Strength of Those Who Know Their God: A. The scripture tells us that those who know their God shall be strong. This strength is not merely physical but encompasses spiritual fortitude and resilience. B. When we know God, we draw strength from His presence. In times of trials and challenges, we find refuge in Him. His power becomes our strength, enabling us to overcome every obstacle. C. Knowing God empowers us to stand firm in our faith, even in the face of adversity. It gives us the courage to boldly proclaim His truth and live according to His principles, regardless of the prevailing circumstances. |III. Doing Exploits: A. The scripture also declares that those who know their God shall do exploits. This implies that knowing God not only transforms us but also empowers us to impact the world around us. B. Doing exploits means stepping out in faith and fulfilling the purposes God has ordained for our lives. It involves acts of love, compassion, and service that reflect God's heart to those around us. C. When we know God, we are infused with His wisdom, creativity, and power, enabling us to accomplish extraordinary feats for His kingdom. Whether it's preaching the gospel, ministering to the needy, or standing up for justice, our lives become a testament to His glory. |Conclusion: My dear brothers and sisters, as we reflect on the profound truth that those who know their God shall be strong and do exploits, let us examine our own relationship with Him. Are we truly seeking to know Him more intimately? Are we allowing His strength to sustain us in every season of life? And are we stepping out in faith to do exploits for His kingdom? May we be inspired to deepen our walk with God, drawing strength from His presence and courageously fulfilling His purposes in the world. And may our lives be a testimony to the transformative power of knowing the one true God. Amen."

      "message": "Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, today I want to talk to you about the importance of having a covenant consciousness in our walk with God. As believers, we are not merely following a set of rules or rituals; rather, we are partakers of a divine covenant—a sacred agreement between God and His people. Understanding and living in the reality of this covenant is crucial for our spiritual growth and relationship with God. |Hebrews 8:6 (NIV) - \"But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.\" |Understanding the Covenant: |a. God is a covenant-making God. Throughout the Bible, we see God making covenants with His people, from Noah and Abraham to Moses and David. These covenants were not mere contracts but sacred promises rooted in God's faithfulness and love. |b. The new covenant, established through Jesus Christ, is superior to the old covenant. It is founded on better promises, sealed by the blood of Jesus, and offers forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life to all who believe. |Hebrews 9:15 (NIV) - \"For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.\" |Living in Covenant Consciousness: |a. Recognize your identity as a covenant child of God. Through Jesus Christ, we are heirs of the promises of God, redeemed from sin and adopted into His family. Our lives are now governed by the principles of God's covenant. |b. Walk in faithfulness and obedience. Just as God is faithful to His covenant promises, we are called to be faithful in our relationship with Him. This involves obeying His commandments, trusting His guidance, and seeking His will in all things. |Psalm 25:14 (NIV) - \"The Lord confides in those who fear him; he makes his covenant known to them.\" |Benefits of Covenant Consciousness: |a. Assurance of God's presence and protection. When we live with an awareness of God's covenant, we can trust that He is always with us, guiding us through every trial and challenge. |b. Access to God's promises. The covenant grants us access to the abundant blessings and provisions of God, including His peace, joy, and strength to overcome. |c. Hope for the future. As heirs of God's covenant, we have the assurance of a glorious inheritance in Christ—an eternity with Him in heaven. |Conclusion: |Dear friends, let us embrace a covenant consciousness in our walk with God. May we remember that we serve a faithful God who keeps His promises and fulfills His covenant with "

      "title": "The Efficacy of Grace- Embracing God's Unmerited Favor",
      "bibleRef": " ",
      "message": "Introduction: Dearly beloved people of God, today we gather to reflect upon and celebrate the boundless and transformative power of God's grace. Grace, often described as God's unmerited favor towards humanity, is a concept that lies at the heart of the Christian faith. It is through grace that we are redeemed, forgiven, and granted eternal salvation. As we delve into the depths of this divine gift, let us open our hearts and minds to fully comprehend its significance in our lives. |1.\tUnderstanding Grace: a. Grace Defined: Grace is the undeserved and unearned love and favor that God freely bestows upon us, regardless of our shortcomings and sins. It is a manifestation of God's boundless mercy and compassion towards humanity. b. Biblical Foundations: Throughout the Bible, we encounter numerous accounts of God's grace in action. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, God's grace is depicted as a foundational element of His relationship with His people. |2.\tThe Source of Grace: a. God's Character: Grace emanates from the very essence of God's character. He is a God of love, mercy, and compassion, and it is out of His infinite goodness that grace flows abundantly towards us. b. Christ's Sacrifice: The ultimate demonstration of God's grace is found in the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Through His atoning sacrifice on the cross, Christ bore the weight of our sins and opened the floodgates of God's grace for all humanity. |3.\tThe Transformative Power of Grace: a. Salvation: It is by grace through faith that we are saved (Ephesians 2:8-9). Our salvation is not achieved through our own works or merits but is a gift freely given by God. b. Forgiveness and Redemption: Through grace, our sins are forgiven, and we are reconciled to God. No matter how far we may have strayed, God's grace has the power to restore and redeem us. c. Empowerment for Living: Grace not only saves us but also empowers us to live transformed lives. It enables us to overcome sin, walk in righteousness, and fulfill the purposes that God has ordained for us. |4.\tEmbracing and Extending Grace: a. Receiving Grace: It is essential for us to humbly receive God's grace with gratitude and humility. We must acknowledge our need for grace and surrender our lives to the transforming power of God's love. b. Extending Grace to Others: Just as we have received grace from God, we are called to extend grace to others. We are called to forgive as we have been forgiven, to love as we have been loved, and to show mercy as we have been shown mercy. |Conclusion: As we conclude our reflection on the efficacy of grace, let us be reminded of the profound truth that we are saved by grace alone. May we embrace God's unmerited favor with hearts full of gratitude and live our lives as vessels of His grace to a world in need. Let us go forth from this place, empowered by God's grace, to shine His light and share His love with all whom we encounter. Amen."

      "message": "Dear Brothers and Sisters, |Today, I want to talk to you about an investment strategy that surpasses any worldly wealth or material possession. It's an investment that yields eternal dividends and holds value far beyond the limitations of our earthly existence. I speak of investing in things that have eternal value. |In a world where we are bombarded with messages about investing in stocks, real estate, or businesses to secure our financial future, it's easy to lose sight of what truly matters. While there's nothing inherently wrong with striving for financial stability, we must recognize that the wealth of this world is transient. It can vanish in an instant, leaving us spiritually bankrupt if we're not careful. |The Bible teaches us in Matthew 6:19-21: \"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\" |Investing in eternal treasures means prioritizing the things of God over temporary pleasures and possessions. It means investing in our relationship with Him, in the lives of others, and in spreading His love and message of salvation. Let's explore three key areas where we can invest in eternal value: |1.\tInvesting in Spiritual Growth: Just as we invest time and effort in our careers and personal pursuits, we must invest in our spiritual well-being. This means spending time in prayer, studying God's Word, and nurturing our relationship with Him. As we grow closer to God, we become more like Him, reflecting His love, grace, and truth to the world around us. |2.\tInvesting in Others: Jesus commanded us to love one another as He has loved us (John 13:34-35). This love isn't passive; it's active and sacrificial. We can invest in others by serving them, sharing the gospel with them, and meeting their practical needs. Every act of kindness, every word of encouragement, and every moment spent in fellowship with fellow believers is an investment in eternity. |3.\tInvesting in Kingdom Work: Jesus commissioned His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). We are called to be ambassadors for Christ, proclaiming the good news of salvation and advancing God's kingdom on earth. This can take many forms, from supporting missions and ministries financially to using our gifts and talents to serve others. |Brothers and sisters, let us not be shortsighted in our investments, focusing solely on the fleeting treasures of this world. Instead, let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), and invest our time, talents, and resources in that which has eternal significance. |May we be wise stewards of all that God has entrusted to us, knowing that our true treasure is found in Him alone. And may our investments in eternity bring glory to His name and bear fruit that lasts for eternity. |"

      "message": "Dearly beloved, as we gather here today, let us reflect on the profound purpose of our existence. In a world often fixated on personal success and individual achievements, it's easy to lose sight of what truly matters—the impact we have on others. Today, we delve into this essential aspect of life, exploring how our actions, attitudes, and words shape the lives of those around us. The essence of life lies not in the accumulation of wealth or fame, but in the profound impact we have on others. As it is written in Philippians 2:4, 'Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.' Let us strive to leave a legacy of love, compassion, and service, knowing that our greatest fulfillment comes from uplifting those around us. |1.\tScriptural Foundation: Let's begin by grounding ourselves in the wisdom of the Scriptures. In Matthew 5:16, Jesus teaches us, \"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.\" This verse underscores the significance of our actions in influencing others and bringing glory to God. |2.\tThe Power of Influence: Every interaction we have, every decision we make, has the potential to impact someone else. Whether it's a simple act of kindness, a word of encouragement, or a demonstration of love, our actions ripple outward, leaving an imprint on the lives of others. |3.\tLiving with Purpose: God has uniquely gifted each of us with talents, skills, and resources. It is our responsibility to steward these gifts wisely, using them to serve others and advance the kingdom of God. As Ephesians 2:10 reminds us, \"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\" |4. The Call to Love: At the heart of impacting others lies the commandment to love. In Mark 12:31, Jesus instructs us, \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" This love extends beyond mere words to tangible acts of compassion and selflessness. As followers of Christ, we are called to embody this love in our daily lives, reaching out to those in need and sharing the hope we have in Christ. |5.\tLeaving a Lasting Legacy: Ultimately, the impact we make on others is our legacy. Whether we realize it or not, we are shaping the future through our interactions and relationships. As we strive to live with purpose and intentionality, let us consider the legacy we are leaving behind—a legacy of faith, love, and transformation. |Conclusion: Dear brothers and sisters, let us go forth from this place with a renewed commitment to impact others for the glory of God. May we be vessels of His love and instruments of His peace in a world longing for hope and healing. Remember, the essence of life is not found in what we acquire for ourselves, but in how much we are able to impact others. Let us live each day with this truth at the forefront of our minds, seeking to make a difference in the lives of those around us. Amen."

      "message": "There is the power that a believer has that put Satan into fear, paralyzes his operations and puts him to flight. It is the power of prayer. This is the only power that destabilises Satan and all his unseen agents, including human agents. The verse preceding our text today says that more report went around concerning Jesus and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities. Jesus did not allow this fame and the crowd to cause distraction to His prayer life, and so He withdrew from them to pray. The simple reason is that the power base of Jesus while on earth as flesh, was prayer. And same applies to every believer.  |The level of the faith life of every believer is as robust as his\/her prayer life. It is by fervent prayer that the believer can activate the power of God to heal, the power of God to deliver and the power of God to uproot and dislodge every work of Satan through the believer. Whereas, singing praises is important to the believer, to acknowledge God and His greatness and to appreciate Him for all that He has done and will do, however prayer is power. This is because even Satan can sing, but he cannot pray. He has no one to pray to. And so, through prayer, the believer activates and keeps the power of God on his or her life 24\/7. |Brethren, this is the secret of the success of Jesus' ministry. Jesus was given to prayers, as can be seen in today's main text. Jesus loved spending quality time in prayer and fellowship with the Father, He did this mostly in the early hours of the day before He sets out to meet the challenges of the day. This is why we must be deliberate about our prayer life. |Another thing is that prayer strengthens our faith. As such, when we do not pray, then we put our faith life at a risk and at the mercy of Satan and his demons. This is why Satan will do everything possible to keep the believer from praying. He knows that when we don't pray, we are no longer a threat to him in any way; but unfortunately, it then makes the prayerless believer a prey to satan. May we not be the enemies prey in Jesus name. Apostle Paul in his letter to Thessalonians said “pray without ceasing…”(1 Thessalonians 5:17). Because failure to pray gives the enemy access to come to the house of the believer to operate unhindered and get away with it. Hence, Jesus says in Luke 18:1 that: \"…men ought always to pray, and not to faint…” We also pray so that we do not fall into temptation (Matthew 26:41-42). Brethren, have you prayed today? May the Lord strengthen our prayer life this year in Jesus' mighty name. |"

      "message": "Every word that a man speaks creates or kills something. Oftentimes, we say things that seem to us to be insignificant, but to the hearer, those words can be life changing either positively or otherwise. This is why the wise king in our text text makes it clear that the tongue has the power to give life or to bring death. This is so because in Numbers 14:28, God instructed Moses to tell the children of Israel that: “I will do to you exactly as I heard you say.” Also, in Joel 3:10, prophet Joel wrote that: \"…let the weak say, I am strong.\" |When God created the entire universe, apart from man who He made with His hands, God called every other thing into existence. And man that He made with His hand is made in His image, therefore man carries God. Because man carries God, and God made everything upon which man was given dominion by God, it follows that when man speaks, because He is the image of God, man's word has the capacity to bring what he utters into existence. Therefore, it is very important for us to use our words to lift people up, speak words of vision and life over the people around us by being positive in our words because the words we utter are seeds that will last throughout eternity.   |Brethren, you may be facing a challenge over the behaviour or attitude of a child or a loved one, it is time for you to change your confession. This is because those negative behavior and attitudes are Satan's implantation in the person, and when you keep uttering every negative word to such persons, you are enforcing the negative thing that Satan has implanted in the life. Therefore, as you pray for such wards, let your confession about them and to them also be positive. Thereby the life of the person is redeemed and that which God created in His own image will be restored.  |Therefore, as a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, teacher or even friend, the children and people in your life who may not be doing well now, all need to hear your words of encouragement on a regular basis to make them to come back to the realisation that they can do something great with their lives. Our words carry incredible power. Therefore, never confess that which you are seeing which is not encouraging but rather confess over such people what God intends for them. Let us remember that God already saw that everything that He created was beautiful, including that child or person that is revolting, unpleasant and\/or nasty.   |Never say to your children or ward things like: \"You're too slow, you are clumsy or you are dumb\"; or even questions like “Why can't you make good grades like your sister\/brother?\" “Why can't you clean your room like your cousin\/niece?” These are words that put the hearing down, and certainly this cannot be your intention. Therefore, let your intention for the life of the person be your confession and not what you are seeing. The scripture says that: “…we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:18). That negative thing you are seeing in the child or ward or work colleague is transient so don't be moved by it. That which is eternal is what God created, therefore focus's on it and confess it. Also, kinds of words are seeds that can take root and affect the person many years later. The truth is every word is a seed which will germinate and grow into what you have confessed. Therefore confess the positive always. Speak life, speak hope, speak vision and speak the positive over the people around you and even over your situation and in the end, you will have that which you speak because your words carry power that you cannot fathom. Therefore, don't speak death but speak life always, and you will have life around you and in the people around you, however bad they or the situation may look. Just as Jesus spoke life to the life of everyone even on the cross of Calvary. Therefore, confess the positive always and you will be creating life and not death.  |"

      "message": "The World today is going through a season in which humanity is like stucked and without purpose, and almost everyone seems confused as to the way out, because evil is on the increase and the fear of God seems to be going down the drain. And, people are thinking more about themselves than about God or fellow men.  However, despite all these, God has not ceased to be God. And so, our text today tells us that God roars from Mount Zion; His voice thunders from Jerusalem; earth and sky tremble; but God will be the shelter for His children and He will defend His people. Therefore, for those who profess to follow Christ, we must make sure that we are truly a people of God.  |Brethren, last year might have ended on a rough note or a kind of hardship for different people at different levels, and with everyone facing different levels of challenges. Income of people also seems no longer sufficient for the basic things of life (even in the midst of plenty). On top of it, and in apparent disregard for the sufferings of others, some people are seen lavishly squandering money and leaving those who are suffering to wonder at whether things can ever change because evil of the heart of man and godlessness seems to be on the increase. But my brethren, just as the text says, God is the strength of His people. And so, even in our puzzling mind as to the way out, Jeremiah gives the answer in Jeremiah 32:17 that: ”Sovereign LORD, you made the earth and the sky by your great power and might; nothing is too difficult for you.“ Brethren, there is nothing too hard for God because His power is limitless, and so are His promises secure, therefore, there is no promise too hard for Him to keep. |God's promise for His children in the present dispensation is that even if the heavens and earth shake, He will be a shelter for His people and be the strength for them. Therefore, if you are one of His people, do not marvel at what will be the way out. Hold unto His promise. He will show forth for you. Let us also call to mind the word of David in Psalm 73:1-28, when David admitted that he also nearly lost confidence and that his faith was almost gone when he saw the prosperity of the wicked; and when he saw how things were going well for the wicked; and they behaved as though God does not know what they do. David was also confused that the evil people have plenty and are always getting more. Until he (David), went into the sanctuary of God. Then, he understood what will happen to these wicked people in the end. Because God will put them in slippery places and make them fall to destruction. But as for David, he found protection with the Sovereign Lord.(Ps.73). This is the exact situation of the world today, and how children of God are feeling. But God has never changed and His promises have never failed. |Therefore brethren, as children of God, let us hold unto Him in the face of all the evil and ungodliness and lack of care for humanity around us. God will surely come forth for us, and because He is our strength, He will fulfil His promise in Joel 2:26 that: \"You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame.” So shall it be for us in Jesus name. |"

      "message": "Countless of stories are told of answered prayers: revealing testimonies of diseases cured, illnesses healed, forgiveness granted, relationships restored, hungry children fed, bills paid and lives and souls saved through the efficacy of prayer. So, there are evidences around us as proofs that God answers prayer. But because most of these evidences are personal; many who think of “evidence” as the only person observable, measurable, and reproducible proofs cannot understand how faith people live by the notion that God answers prayers. The truth however is that God's answer to your prayers is not dependent on whether the godless man would believe it or not.  |The text of today is Jesus' word, and this is the same thing that the Psalmist reveals that the Almighty God says i.e.“call on me and I will answer”(Psalm 50:15). God is God, and He is not dependent on anyone. If He says it, surely He will do it. But, the answer to the prayer of one who decides to pray would also depend on whether such a person believes in the ability of God to answer his\/her prayer or not. This is why the writer of the Book of Hebrews says: “...for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him\" (Hebrews 11:6). |If God says: “call on me...I will answer” and Jesus Christ also says: “Ask and you will receive”; brethren, it is a done deal. No matter what comes your way, all you need to do is to call on God, and wait for His answer. He will surely answer. Because He says: “My word shall not return to me void,” in other words, His promise to answer cannot be in vain; it is sacrosanct and nothing can change it. This is why John in his letter explains that: “...whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep His commandments and do what pleases Him (1 John 3:22). That which pleases Him is your faith. Your faith is the proof that you know that He cannot lie, you know that He does not fail in His promises; you know that since He gave Jesus, there is nothing He wouldn't give. And so, Your Faith pleases Him and it brings forth your answer (Romans 8:32). |Brethren, whatever you have been looking onto God for in the past years, trust Him, He has you on His agenda, because you dared to ask Him. He will surely do it. Remember that He is your creator and He knows the right time for everything to come your way with perfect peace attending it. So, in the January victory month of fasting and prayer, be engaged in serious praying and keep trusting. God answers prayers. He will answer yours. Because you trusted God and waited on Him, the time for your favour is now (Psalms 102:13)."

The Bible says of Sarah and her husband that: “Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.” (Genesis 18:11). To her the hope of child bearing was no longer there. It was a situation that even if anybody came to pray for her to have a child, she would probably not say “amen”. Hence, when the Angel told her that she would have a child, she laughed to herself, saying, \"After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?\" (Genesis 18:12 ). Another example is the situation of Lazarus. When Jesus eventually got there, Martha said to Jesus, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died (John 11:21). This is because Lazarus had died for four days before Jesus' arrival. We were like they that dreamed, is a situation that makes a man not believe that it is the reality. Another example is Genesis 45:26. Jacob had believed that Joseph was dead for more than 20 years. Suddenly he was told that Joseph was alive, the Bible says: his response was: “Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.” Also in Luke 24:11, when Mary told the disciples that Jesus had risen from the dead, the Bible also says that “they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.” Also, in Acts 12:9 Peter had been in prison, and God had sent an angel to take Peter out of prison. The Bible says that: “Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.” |Brothers and sisters, whatever is your challenge that seems to have defiled solution, whatever seems to you like a dead end, the God of restoration shall arise for you. In the few days left in this year, God is able to do far above your expectations or the expectations of your enemy against you. And just as the restoration of Israel when suddenly they were returned from captivity, your restoration will be like a dream in Jesus name. Brethren, no matter what your situation may be, no matter what you are going through, no matter what you might have lost, if only you can trust God, however hard or tough it may be, the Lord never disappoints anyone. He will always come forth for His children because of His name and for His Glory |As the Psalmist says in verse 2 that: “Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, \"The LORD has done great things for them”, in this season, the God of restoration will arise for you, show Himself mighty in your life and your mouth will be filled with laughter in Jesus name. Amen."

      "bibleRef": "“And we all, with unveiled face, continually seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are progressively being transformed into His image from [one degree of] glory to [even more] glory, which comes from the Lord, [who is] the Spirit” (2 Corinthians 3:18 AMP).",
      "message": "When something is an image of the other it can mean: (1) a representation of the external form of a person or thing i.e. likeness or resemblance or (2) the general impression that a person, organization, or product presents to the public. So, when the Bible says we are the image of Christ it means: (1) we are the representation or likeness of Christ and (2) people also have an impression of that Christlikeness of us by the way we live our lives. Hence in our text today, Apostle Paul tells the Christians in Corinth that we reflect the glory of the Lord (Jesus) as He makes us more like Him through the Holy Spirit, and we manifest Him. And the said manifestation of Christ Jesus would be in everything. This is why as Christians, we are able to (1) care for others, (2) bear with others and (3) share Christ with others, even with the worst of persons. |Looking at Paul's letter in today's text and his letter to the Christians in Rome in Romans 12:2 that says: “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” One thing is common to the two scripture verses, and this is the word 'transformed'. To be transformed simply means to metamorphous like when the caterpillar changes to the butterfly. In other words, to be change totally from one thing to another. Therefore, the Christian is expected to be a completely changed person through the Holy Spirit, and become the likeness of Jesus, and become Christlike. |The question for us is have truly metamorphosed? When the caterpillar changes to a butterfly no one sees anything in resemblance of the caterpillar anymore. In fact, the butterfly flies around, no one stops to consider whether what they are seeing is a butterfly or a caterpillar. Just in the same way that when you see the caterpillar, a butterfly does not cross your mind as what you are seeing. This is how Christ expects the changes in our lives to be, and how the perception of people should be. The Christian is not supposed to live like a bat that is neither a bird nor a mammal. The believers' life is not supposed to confuse the perception of the people around us. The change that we receive as Christians is the one that has metamorphous into a Christ-like being and God is glorified in everything about our lives. It is a miracle to become like Christ. However, when we present ourselves to God with a willingness to be changed, God does His own work and a change comes to our heart. Only God can make the change.  |Brethren, may be there are things that you still find yourself doing and you are wondering why you find yourself doing what you don't want to do. Paul was there at one point in his life, hence he wrote: “For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate” (Romans 7:15). This morning, if you are struggling with truly changing to become the true likeness of Christ, struggling with forgiveness, struggling with praying for the one that hurt you, or struggling with passionately loving God like Daniel, and the three Hebrew Boys did; all you need is the power of the Holy Spirt. When you receive God's Spirit, He empowers your and Christ will puts His Mark on you, to Make you different and to be like Him. But the first step is your will! Your will to leave your old ways of life! Your will to permit the Holy Sprit to control your doings! Today, ask for the infilling of the Holy Spirit and you will become the true image of Christ, empowered to turn away from every sinful desire. May you receive Him and be His true image. |"

And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done” (Genesis 8:21 AMP).",
      "message": "In our text of today, we can see that God smelled an aroma from the burnt offering of the sacrifice of Noah and God was so pleased that He made a vow never to destroy living creatures as He just did. God then followed this promise with a vow in Vs.22 that: As long as earth remains, “seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.\" There are five senses that man has i.e. sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch, but it would appear that the sense of smell is a very powerful one and it usually leaves unforgettable memories. Interestingly, our text today shows that the smell sense was donated to man by God.  |So, today, we will talk about God that desires SWEET AROMA from us. From the text, we can see that God puts smell and pleasant memories together. The flood has just gone and Noah's family is able to come out of the ark onto dry ground. God had told Noah to build the Ark and to take his family and two of a kind of every animal, bird and fish into the Ark. Noah obeyed. Flood came but Noah's family was saved from the destruction. And now they can come out of the Ark. (Genesis 6:13-22). When Noah and his family came out alive, in appreciation to God for preserving him and his family, Noah built an altar to the Lord, took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar (vs.20). This aroma of the burnt offering positively provoked God to determine not to ever destroy the earth in anger. And the Bible says that: “The Lord smelt the pleasing aroma!” |Today, there are no sacrifices anymore because Jesus our High Priest offered and made a once and for all sacrifice of Himself to God for our redemption. (Hebrews 7:27). God however desires a sweet aroma to rise up to Him which reminds Him of His promises. What is this sweet aroma that God desires? It is our prayer. The Psalmist says in Psalm 141:2 that: “May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.” This is the sacrifice of intercessory prayer. When we pray for the salvation of the lost souls, such prayers go to go as sweet “smelling” aroma creating in God a pleasant memory. And just on the basis of the aroma – God says He will remember His covenant. This is the essence of the letter of Paul in Ephesians 5:1-2 that says: \"Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.\" Let us think and ask ourselves how many times we have remembered the lost souls in our individual private prayers? This is the aroma that God desires. When we do, He remembers His covenant and He in turn blessed the life that raised such sweet smelling aroma of prayer to Him. Jesus has already been sacrificed for these ones. |Today, let each of us make a list of the lost souls that are members of our family, work colleagues, neighbours or classmates and let's raise the sweet aroma of prayer to God and we will see how God will bless our lives. This is what pleases God, as He hears our prayers, He makes them to hear and respond to the gospel. They get saved and it is recorded as credit in heaven to the one that prays to God for their salvation. God is asking for this sweet aroma of prayer from us. |"

The Jews were to be a light to other nations. As believers, we all bear the name of “Christ” and we are also light to the world. As light to the world, we call the name of the Lord and as such are called by the name of the Lord. Therefore, the fourth Commandment is for us too.  |But how are we not to call on His name in vain? How we call the name of the Lord in vain is not only by swearing in God's name, but more on how the unbelievers see us. Do the unbelievers know you as nothing but a liar, yet you carry the name of Christ? Then, you are calling it in vain. Do your neighbours see you every Sunday going to church to worship and every other day you curse your husband, your wards, neighbours and even your children, then you are calling the name of Christ in vain. Do your friends and co-workers see you with Bible on your table and in your locker, yet you are the accounts clerk or accountant that they will meet to doctor the Books so that N50,000 becomes N50,000,000 and you collect your own share without blinking an eye. You bear the name of Christ in vain. Do your class mates know you as the fellowship leader but when it comes to how to hack into the system to get the questions of upcoming exam, you conspire with others or you even pay money to get the questions from the hackers, then you bare the name of Christ in vain. Do other business people around you know that you are a member of the women fellowship of your church, or the leader of the ladies of the church, yet the husbands of other women are your choice men; or your weighing bow to weigh gari and other grains as a trader is more panel beaten than that of the unbelievers, just to make more money for less goods given, then you bare the name of Christ in vain. As a Politician, you are always called upon to pray anytime there is a deliberation because others see you as a Christian, but you would agree with any decision as long as you get your share of the loot, then you bare the name of Christ in vain.  |Brethren, the entire Text of the Old Testament is a clarion call for us all to reconsider our ways and our actions and how we portray ourselves to others as believers through our actions and inactions. Yes, they hear us call the name of the Lord, plead His Blood and yet, the things you do or join hands with others to do do not show you as a true follower of Christ, then the name of Christ that they see us call and or answer to is in vain.  |Brethren, let us always remember that just as the Israelites were called to be a “kingdom of priests” as written in Exodus 19:6, every believer also belongs to the kingdom of Priests, and also Royalty as written in 1 Peter 2:9. Let us reconsider our ways. The good news about the gospel of Christ is that we only need to turn back to Him, turn a new leaf and ask for His Grace for you to live right and He will wear you His Complete righteousness. Do not take the name of God in vain.  |"

      "message": "The word “here” means “in, at, or to this place, situation or position”. Our text today says the that the Word (Jesus) became flesh and lives among us. Jesus Christ then confirms this in Matthew 28:20b, by saying: “And be sure of this: I am with you always...” Jesus is surely with us always. Jesus is not only with us but He desires to be in everything that we do and for us to let Him be the master of everything so that we do not make any mistake, and Satan does not have any way to manipulate us. |By the dictionary definition of HERE earlier quoted, HERE also includes situation, i.e. any situation that we or our loved ones are. Therefore, no matter what your situation is right now or in this season, as long as you are in Christ, Jesus is also in it. This is why God's Word specifically declared God's promise in Isaiah 43:2 that: “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you.” One of the things that water symbolizes in the Bible is trouble, problems, challenges and issues. And so, even in the present battle that you are going through, Jesus says I am HERE, I am in it with you. If yours is that you need to make a decision which appears tough, Jesus says, I am HERE, let me give you the decision. And when Jesus is in it and you allow Him to take charge, the outcome cannot be less than success and victory. An example is when the disciples were sailing and there was ferocious storm, and the boat was like going to capsize. Jesus was also in the boat but he was sleeping. When the disciples saw that Jesus was sleeping, they wondered why Jesus did not care that they could perish. Jesus simply rebuked the storm saying “Be still” and everything went quiet. Then Jesus asked them: “Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?\" (Mark 4:40). The disciples wondered and said to each other: \"Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?\"(Mark 4:41) |Brethren, that is how we are too. We easily get overwhelmed by challenges that we forget that the Master of Seas and Waves is in the boat with us. Jesus' promise to be with us always; (including in times of trouble) is sacrosanct, nothing can change it because He does not go back on His Word. Hence the writer of Hebrews says in Hebrews 6:18 that: “so that by two unchangeable things [His promise and His oath] in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled [to Him] for refuge would have strong encouragement and indwelling strength to hold tightly to the hope set before us.” Part of the hope set before us is hope in victory over every challenge and we will have the victory.  |Coming back to the main text taken from the Book of John, Jesus is as much with each of us now, as He was with His disciples. Therefore brethren, the good news for you today is that, the present situation that looks like the enemy is having an upper arm will not overcome you because it can never overcome Jesus. You will be the testifier and Jesus will be glorified. Because Jesus is here as much as He was with the disciples, trust Him, he is here with you. |"

      "bibleRef": "",
      "message": " Introduction,| The brief, simple and direct mandate of Scripture is that \"whatever you do, do all to the glory of God\" (1 Cor 10:31). All of God's creation is to be absorbed with putting the glory of God on display. When the angels announced the Savior's birth, they were joined by the heavenly host, glorifying God (Luke 2:14). The shepherds responded by glorifying God following their visit to the Christ-child in the manger (Luke 2:20). Even the physical creation incessantly declares His glory (Ps 19:1-2). |While the importance of this mandate is not lost on most Christians, its fulfillment frequently is. We heed lip-service, often closing our prayers of petition with, “and we'll be sure to give you all the glory.” But when the answer comes, we, much like the nine lepers, are often so elated that we fail to make good on our promise. |How can we follow the example of creation or join in the chorus with the shepherds and the heavenly host in glorifying God? The answer, I believe, is found in Exodus 33:18-34:8. When Moses asks to see the glory of God, God puts His glory on display by rehearsing His attributes, and thereby demonstrates how we can give God the glory that belongs to Him.  |Here are six ways you can put the glory of God on display: |1. Confess sin |When we confess sin, we are putting on display His glory by declaring His righteousness. That is David's point in Psalm 51:4: “Against You, You only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that You are justified when You speak and blameless when you judge.” |2. Forgive others |Our God is a forgiving God (Ps 130:3-4; Mic 7:18-19). When we forgive others, we are proclaiming His compassion and eagerness to forgive. It has been said that we are never more God-like than when we forgive. That is why the Lord places so much emphasis on forgiving others in the disciples' prayer (Mt 6:12, 14-15). Forgiving others puts His glory on display. |3. Trust God |If God does all things for our good (and He does), then demonstrating our trust in Him puts His nature and character on display. We reflect who He is. The life of Abraham provides a remarkable example of this. Romans 4:20 notes that, “with respect to the promise of God, Abraham did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God.” At the end of his life, Paul recounts how the Lord stood with him, strengthened him, and rescued him from every evil deed, and concludes that the Lord will bring him safely to his heavenly kingdom, to Him be the glory forever and ever (2 Tim 4:17-19). Trusting God declares His glory. |4. Produce fruit |Jesus says: “My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit”  |(John 15:8). Living a life that adorns God's attributes puts His glory on display. When His communicable attributes are reflected in our lives, it not only produces fruit, but it glorifies God. |5. Give thanks |Psalm 50:23 says, “He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies Me.” Expressions of gratitude to God sets His glory on a pedestal. Thanksgiving directs our focus on the One who is the Giver of every good and perfect gift  |(James 1:17).  First Thessalonians 5:18 reminds us of God's sovereign orchestration of all of life for the believer (cf. Rom 8:28). Thanksgiving acknowledges that and thereby reflects His glory. |6. Pray |Like giving thanks, prayer shines the spotlight on God's attributes of goodness and omnipotence. The Lord encourages and invites us to, “Call upon Me in the day of trouble and I will rescue you and you will glorify me” |(Ps 50:15). In John 14:13 He adds, “Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” |Glorifying God is not a memorized mantra of special words or phrases. Rather, it is a life that reflects the attributes of God, a lifestyle that is consumed with putting His glory on display. Like a city built on a hill or a lamp set on a lamp stand, glorifying God entails letting the light of the attributes of God shine before men so that others will join with us in glorifying our Father in heaven (Matt 5:14-16). |"

It is in fulfilling God's purpose that His glory is released in your life. |In John 2:11, Jesus performed the first miraculous sign and the Bible says \" ... this revealing His glory\".

What He has set for you and me is beyond what the mind can understand or the eyes can see. However, many of His children today are living below their potential because of the works of glory killers. It is time for you to arise and say like David, \" Arise my glory\", as you confront the glory killers in your life. |GLORY KILLERS |Glory killers are the things that can hinder the glory of God from manifesting. The things that can hinder your intimacy with God. Those things that can make you fall short and not meet up with expectations for your life. These killers are as follows: |1. Disobedience |Disobedience can be outright refusal to do what the Lord wants you to do. Disobedience can be delay in acting on God's instructions for you. Disobedience can be being selective of what to do and what not to do. |Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord by eating of the fruit of good and evil Genesis 3: 6-7. |Saul disobeyed by sparing the king of Amalek and leaving some choice animals 1Samuel 15: 7-9 |One moment of disobedience can have long lasting consequences not just for the persons concerned but also the people connected to them. |The disobedience of the children of Eli led to “Ichabod,” the glory departing from Israel and from the family. 1 Samuel 2: 30-35; 4:21 |In what areas are you disobeying God's instructions? |In what areas are you doubting God's instructions? |The effect of the disobedience of Adam and Eve caused man to fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23.  |2.         Anger-  |So many would have gone far and achieve more but for their inability to control their anger.  |Many have destroyed what they labored for because of anger.  |Lack of self-control has led many to truncate the plans of God for their lives. |Moses was a man known for his anger. Exodus 32:19; Numbers 20:9-10. |Anger can lead to regret when actions and words spoken at the heat of the moment become irreparable and irreversible – Ecclesiastes 7:9; Proverbs 29:11- “A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control.” (NIV) |Anyone who can make you angry can control you- Proverbs 16:32 |Stop making excuses for your anger- James 1:20 'For the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.” |3.         Immorality-  |Many glories have been destroyed on the platter of immorality. |Many have sold themselves to the devil and become crippled emotionally and psychologically as a result of sinful and filthy acts of immorality. |One does not even have to leave his room these days to get into all kinds of immorality.  |The internet has made it open to all and sundry and only those who are disciplined and committed to the Lord can overcome. |Samson's glory was destroyed abruptly because he refused to keep himself in check. Judges 16:19ff – “She lulled him to sleep on her knees…and his strength left him.” |The relationship of a man and woman can only be consummated in marriage. Hebrews 13:4. |Conclusion |One of the things the devil is looking for is to turn people's glory into rag. There are lots of glory that are being turned to rags due to disobedience to God's word and parents, anger and immorality. Parents that are careless with children can make their children's glory to be turned to rags. Friends that you aren't supposed to be attached to can make your glory to turn to rags. When your life is full of sin, the devil has a chance to make your life  turned to rag or kill your glory. |"

Satan cannot stand where the name of Jesus dwells. The Bible says: “so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth” (Philippians 2:10). There is no doubt that the name of Jesus in us will put satanic powers to flight. As Christians, God is in us and Jesus has given us power over the all satanic powers. For He says: “I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy and nothing shall hurt you.\"  |But, if someone has an authority and does not use it, those who should be subject to him\/her will override such a person. When we have submitted to God, we must exercise the authority that God has given us in the name of Jesus. Brethren, as believers, we are more powerful than the enemy because, He who is in us is greater than he who is in the world. (See 1 John 4:4). According to our main text today, Jesus already gave His life for us to set us free from this present evil age. The world is full of evils and humans are the tools in the hand of Satan to perpetuate the evils. But their power is limited as far as it concerns those who are in Christ. And so, as the Bible says, “When He (Jesus) ascended on high, He led captivity captive...” (Eph. 4:8). This is the evidence of His triumph over every enemy, and this demonstrates what the Psalmist reveals in Psalm 68:18; which is reference to the resurrection of Jesus. Jesus first rose from the lower parts of the earth, and then ascended far above all the heavens. Hence, once you are in Christ, you are above the powers of the enemy. Though the enemy would try all manners of schemes and attacks, but you already have victory over all them. Our duty is simply to have firm faith in Him and not to engage in wilful sin. |This week, I charge you to maintain your stand in Christ. He gave His life for your victory, and so your victory is not in your own self through power, fame or strength that you may acquire, but it is victory in Christ. As you continue to stand on the word of God, you can jolly well slam the door on the devil; exercise your authorities over him because, you have assured victory in Christ; and there's nothing in this life that can overcome anyone in Him. Although you must not go about sinning, but even when you do sin because we are flesh, God's word says: “...we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins...” (1 John 2:1-2). We have victory over every evil and satanic powers. Hallelujah! |"

      "prayer": "Heavenly Father, I thank You for Your Word, Lord, I open my heart to You totally ready to receive all You have for me, teach me to live a life that is pleasing to You so that I can be an example of Your love and walk in the fulness of Your blessings in Jesus' name. Amen.",
      "bibleRef": "\"But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ\"(Romans 15:29 NKJV).",
      "message": "Paul wrote the above text in his letter to the Christians in Rome. He was telling them, \"I have no doubt that when I meet you, it will be in the fullest measure of Christ's blessing.\" This letter shows that there are various degrees, or measures, of the blessings that come with proclaiming the gospel of Christ. And, one of the biggest blessings of the gospel of Christ is that proclaiming it reminds you of the power of that the Gospel of Christ possesses. The power to change the life of any man for good. This is confirmed by the letter of the same Apostle Paul written to the Christians in Rome, as recorded in Romans 1:16 says that: “I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes”. The message of Jesus is so powerful that most of the evangelism we read about in the New Testament centres around Jesus and the disciples reaching out to complete strangers with the Good News. These were people they bumped into along the way. They were people like the fishermen, the tax collectors, and the everyday Jones and Joneses of our time and who needed the message of hope. |These kind of people are all around us today. On the streets, in our offices, in schools and etc. And I dare to say they need the Gospel message now and even more than ever before. |Jesus said to his disciples in Luke 22:35; “...When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?\" \"Nothing,\" they answered. The Blessing of the gospel can be said to be threefold i.e  |Spiritual Well-being |General well-being and Financial Well-being and health. |The first one has to do with the creative order in our Spiritual lives. When we preach the gospel, our spiritual life is also kept in tune with Christ . It is a principle of life that you cannot give what you do not have. If you are a born again Christian and you are having challenges with the way you are living your spiritual life; start to speak to others about Christ. When you preach the Word to others it will at the same time speak to the area of your weakness; thereby you will break the power of the enemy over your weak area by the Word as it also checks your life.  |The second is the blessing of general well-being and finances. This includes all the physical, material and financial well-being of the believer. By implication, the blessings of the gospel brings changes in our attitude and our thought patterns are no longer the same. The blessing of the gospel helps us to rethink our misguided thoughts especially in terms of material and financial wealth in that we will be more Christ-focussed and heaven conscious. And this brings us into the perfection that Christ bears on us. We are able to run away from sin, from temptation to get rich, as we identify the temptations and overcome it by the Word. We are also able to forgive instantly and give freely. And this gives us fulfillment, satisfaction and enjoyment of the fulness of His blessings. |The third blessing is our health. Divine healing is received when we preach the gospel. When our minds are in tune with Christ through the gospel we are able to easily receive divine healing, because Christ Himself prepares His vessel and keeps us in good health. Hence the scripture says by His Stripes we are already healed. |Brethren, let us live in obedience to the last commission of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 28:19 that: “Go ye into the world and make disciples...”;. This is because, by sharing Jesus with those we know, Jesus blesses us in return. Let us invest God's Word in the unbelievers around us and introduce them to the Lord. This ensures the fullness of His Blessings in our lives. God likes to outdo Himself in blessing us. He wants to open doors for us and bring out talents and abilities that we didn't even know we had. We serve a God of abundance! He is the God of more than enough. Not only does He want to meet our needs, He also wants to give us enough to bless other people. That is living in the fullness of the blessing. Today, look for a lost soul around you and share the gospel of Christ with him\/her. Jesus wants you to talk about Him to others as you would like to talk about those things and people that bring joy to your heart. Speaking Christ to others is being proud of Christ. He is proud of us with the Father, we also must be proud of Him with men. As we do, He opens the channel of the three-fold blessings into our lives. |"

      "message": "Challenges are said to be part of life, and as such, at some points in one's life, challenges will come. But Jesus says don't worry! Because with God, you will overcome.  |As humans, we only need to trust His Word and do only the right things. His word has been given ahead of any kind of challenges. This is why we must not worry because our worrying will only drive away our faith. God's Word through the wise king says: “Worry can rob you of happiness, but kind words will cheer you up.” (Proverbs 12:25 GNB). The kind word that we need is the word of God; every word of God for His children is His kindness. Apostle Peter writes in his letter that you should leave all your worries with God because He cares for you (1 Peter 5:7). |Have you, your health or finances, your family, your career been affected or impacted negatively by some situations or challenges of life or any other negative circumstance? Do you have a challenge over your child or a loved one? His Word says don't worry, just stay your mind on Him. Prophet Isaiah reveals the promise of God in His word that: \"You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. Trust in the LORD forever, For in the LORD, is everlasting strength\" (Isaiah 26:3). What a promise! Perfect peace! God promises that we can have perfect peace, and even be kept in a place of perfect peace no matter what the challenges may be once you trust in Him.  |We might be thinking that some people have peace, but it is a fleeting peace because they are never kept in that peace. Others can be kept in a kind of peace, but it is not a perfect peace, it is the peace of the wicked, the peace of their wealth, the peace through their power or position or the peace of the fortresses that they have built for themselves. In the end all these other kinds of peace will ultimately fail and the end will be destruction because God is not in it. But there is a perfect peace that the LORD will keep you in. The source of which is that you keep our mind stayed, settled and established upon the LORD Himself and His Word; then we can be kept in this perfect peace.  |The Book of Revelations 19:13 says: “And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called the word of God.” That is Jesus Christ. He is the word and He alone is worthy of our trust. It is not to say the problem or issue is not there, but His word is what matters, and the Bible says that if God is for you, no one can be against you (Romans 8:31). And because no one can be against us, all things will work together for our good (Romans 8:28). The Psalmist says: \"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\" (Psalms 23:4) |You can overcome the battle of your mind with His Word. His word is our everlasting strength. Therefore, no matter the tough challenges, let the fact of the confession of Zeresh, the wife of Haman, further strengthen you. She said to her husband: \"If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not overcome him but will surely fall before him\"  (Esther 6:13). It is the same for us in Christ. Because of Christ, we belong to the Most High God and every enemy will fall before us. Therefore, my dear brethren, whatever is your challenge, do that which Christ says, which is: “Do not worry”. Yours is the victory through Christ."

      "message": "“Be Still” - This is a most powerful two word statement in Psalm 46:10. \"Be still and know that I am God...” My study reveals that the Hebrew definition of “Be Still” means “to stop striving”; to let go, to surrender...” The time that Psalm 46 was written was when Judah was invaded by the Assyrians. No doubt that when a nation is being invaded can be a most traumatic period for any leader and the people. Same with if a man's life is invaded by difficult problems, like all the calamities that came to job, all in one day as recorded in Job 1:13-19. But even under such difficult circumstances, the Psalmist recognizes that the only solid fortress is God and He refers us to God's Word that: \"Be still and know that I am God.\"  It is the most assuring word that any man needs in times of trouble, because God's power of deliverance cannot be overcome by anyone or anything. |Another time that these two word statement is made was when Jesus and His disciples were on the sea and there was a huge storm and the boat was like going to sink. When the Disciples in their panic, seeing their Master fast asleep despite what appears life threatening, and they wondered if Jesus didn't care that they could all die, My Lord Jesus simply issued the command: “Peace, Be Still!”  And instantly the storm and the huge waves stopped.  Jesus told the storm to “Shut up” and it obeyed, because Jesus is Lord and He is the Word (Revelation 19:13). When Israelite King saw all the looming calamity and possible carnage with the Assyrians and the rest; the word of God came to him that: “Be still and know that I am God” |Beloved, we may face challenge(s) that look like the multitude of the powerful Assyrian Army or like the turbulent storm, or like a big mountain. Be it a challenge of meeting your basic daily needs due to the present economic crunch, or as big as discharging your responsibilities of school fees, or any other mountainous problem; there is Good News for us as children of God. And the Good News is that because Jesus is the Lord of our lives, He not only sees or knows the situation and the terrible season we are in, but He is actually in it with us, as He promises in Isaiah 43:2-5. Nothing has ever overcome God. Let us rest on His Word, trusting and focusing on Him like a little child will focus on its mother feeding him\/her. You will surely overcome as Israel overcame the Assyrian king in 2 kings 18 and 19. The Lord of Hosts is with you, the God of Jacob is your stronghold, your refuge, and your high tower, therefore, “Be Still”, you will surely overcome. |"

The secret place of God also can mean the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle or Temple. It is also the sacred chamber, the abode of the Shekinah Glory of God's presence. The secret place of the Most High therefore refers to the place of God's presence. God has a secret place, and He wants His children not just to visit but to dwell there and make it our own address and permanent place of abode. |In the first two verses of Psalm 91, the Psalmist reveals to us two major benefits of permanently dwelling in the secret place of God. These are: |1. You will be under the shadow of the Almighty. In other words, a place of assured protection.  |2. God will be your refuge and your fortress. Meaning that God is a place of defense and protection for us against large-scale attacks. |In the remaining verses 3-16, the Psalmist sets out and describes the specific ways that God will protect and care for us as His children and these are that: |I. God's rescue from traps of the enemy. |II. God's protection from deadly disease. |III. We have no cause to be afraid  |IV. No disaster at day or at night.  |V. No evil will conquer us |VI.

      "bibleRef": "\"And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger\" (Genesis 25:23 ESV).",
      "message": "The Bible did not exactly tell us how old Jacob was when he received the blessings of Esau by deception, but going by Genesis 25:27, we know that they were no longer children nor teenagers but grown men. And in our today's main text in Genesis 25:23, God revealed to Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau as she carried them in her womb as twins that: “the elder shall serve the younger”. This shows that somehow, by divine arrangement, election and predestination, God already placed the younger one in a position of authority over the older; but at the appropriate time.  |Unfortunately, both Rebekah the mother of Jacob, and to whom God gave the revelation, with Jacob himself, would rather scheme to take over and steal the blessing that was originally for Jacob himself from God. This is how flesh also makes us as believers, but humans to steal from ourselves what God already has planned to be ours.  |We scheme, strive and deceive just to get those things that God already had in His plans for us as covenant children. Although, Jacob and Esau were twins, but there was a covenant over Jacob. Romans 9:11-12 say: “But in order that the choice of one son might be completely the result of God's own purpose, God said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.” He said this before they were born, before they had done anything either good or bad; so God's choice was based on his call, and not on anything they had done. There's also a covenant of greatness for us through the Blood of Jesus. It was God's choice to place Jacob in a position of great blessings over and above Esau. But Jacob would rather steal what was already his - talk of stealing from oneself. Brethren, this also applies to us as believers of today. Believers scheme and strive and do all manner of things, including trickery like Jacob, just to achieve a great purpose on earth. Stealing from oneself only brings hardship and oftentimes prolongs the time for fulfillment. This is because such schemes only show lack of trust in God's ability to bless us and lift us up.  |In Jeremiah 29:11, God says “I alone know the plans I have for you, plans to bring you prosperity and not disaster, plans to bring about the future you hope for.” This is a great promise that almost every believer knows by heart. But how much do we believe in God for this promise of His great plan. Just like Jacob, every man has a potential to strive and scheme for achievement because flesh would always strive but a Spirit filled man would rest on God. Jacob needed to have an encounter with God to come to the full understanding of God as the way and the promise keeper, who will never break His covenant.   |How far can man go in their schemes and striving without God? How far can our strivings take us? Not so far I guess. And if at all, it does for any man, it is always with painful experiences and a lot of avoidable sufferings and ungodly sacrifices. This is why we need Divine Encounter. Let us again consider the situation that Jacob suddenly found himself. A man that was always tied to his mother's apron, a man enjoying to comfort of his father's house; suddenly in one day and unexpectedly becoming a fugitive. There's no record of Jacob ever leaving home before his trickery and deception of his father, just to foolishly steal from himself that which God had given him before he was born. May we not become fugitives from the comfort of the kingdom of God, because that is the agenda of the enemy for every believer. And although, like God did for Jacob, God will keep His covenant and fulfill His promises to us according to His Word in 2 Timothy 2:13 that even when we are faithless God remains faithful because He cannot deny himself; but we would only have brought unnecessary and untold hardship upon ourselves through scheming and stealing from ourselves that which God purposed for us. Thereby we prolong the full manifestation of the blessings of God.  |For Jacob to be free from the bondage of stealing what belonged to him, he had to have an encounter with God in Genesis 28:12-15 when God re-affirmed His promises that: (1) I will give to you and to your descendants the land. (2) Your descendants will be as numerous. (3) Through you and your descendants I will bless all the nations. (4) I will be with you. (5) I will protect you. (6) I will bring you back to this land. (7) I will never leave you until I have done all that I have promised you. |Brethren, all the above were fulfilled for Jacob and his descendants after his encounter with God. You and I are part of Jacob's descendants by adoption through the Blood of Jesus. Jesus also reaffirms these promises to us in His Word and severally too. He says in Matthew 6:33 that “Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added unto you”. Also in Matthew 28:20 that: “…I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.” These are assurances of Divine Provision, Presence of God, Protection, Guidance and Guardian of God. Brethren, are you stealing from yourself, the blessings that are yours from before you were born by scheming and unnecessary strivings, or are you being lured into ungodly things like deception to get wealth and\/or promotion? This happens because of flesh that is ever so weak, as Jesus reveals in Matthew 26:41. This is why as believers, we all need Divine encounter to overcome the flesh so that we do not keep stealing from ourselves, that which God has for us in His own Divine agenda, and so that we do not have to suffer like a fugitive before we manifest the blessings of God. Let us therefore stop stealing that which belongs to us. "

      "bibleRef": "\"And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net\" (Luke 5:5\tKJV).",
      "message": "The situation that the economy of the entire world is today can be described as what the scripture says of Simon in our text today. That is, toiling without much or anything at all to show for it. The dictionary gives two definition to toiling, which are: (1) to work extremely hard and (2) to move slowly and with difficulty. In the story of Simon, his mother in-law was very sick, he was also having financial problems as he owed some taxes which he had not paid and the Roman soldiers were after him. The consequences of being behind in tax payment was not a palatable one. Simon decided to go a fishing at night because it is believed that during the night, there was a much greater prospect of a good catch. If one did not catch anything during the night, the chances of a good catch during the day become even smaller. |The situation of the world in different jurisdictions, and particularly for many of us in our nation can be likened to Simon's. There is so much hard work with little to show for it, because the cost of living has become astronomically high with the value of the currency extremely low and almost valueless. And everyone appears lost for solution. In the Book of Luke chapter 5, we are told that Jesus had used Simon's boat to preach and when he finished, Jesus told Simon who had released the boat to Him, to let down his nets for a catch. Simon did not think: “what does this man know about fishing?”  Or “what is this man talking about?” Simon must have thought, this man is not an ordinary man and so, Simon, in obedience said: “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing, but at Your Word”. The result as recorded in Luke 5:6 is that when Peter did as Jesus instructed, they caught such a large number of fishes, that their nets began to break. |Brethren, in the situation that the economy of our nation and indeed, the entire world is, whereby the spending power of people has been brought down to almost nothing in relation to what people earn, it is time for the children of God's kingdom to listen to whatever God has to say to us. At any rate, the Bible says in Philippians 3:20 that “our citizenship is in heaven…”. Therefore we are only ambassadors on earth and thus bound by what our Heavenly Father says to us on how not to suffer unnecessary hardship in the midst of nothing. Let us remember that our God is the God that has the power to bring something out of nothing. Examples of such dare situations abound in the Bible as we see the situation at the wedding at Cana. They suddenly ran out of wine and the groom was about to receive the worst embarrassment of his life; Mary the mother of Jesus said: “whatever He tells you to do, do it” (John 2:5).  Also, in Genesis 26:1, the Bible says that there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And God told Isaac to remain in Gerar of the Philistines. God told him that He will bless Isaac as seen in Vs. 2-5. And in Vs.12 the Bible says that”… Isaac sowed seed in that land, and that year he harvested a hundred times as much as he had sown, because the LORD blessed him.” |The situation is certainly a serious one and difficult time, but let us go to God as His children. He will speak and He will make a way for us. He will supply our needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus as written in Philippians 4:19. In John 2:5, Mary said whatever Jesus tells them to do they should do it. They did and they had the best wine because lack had to bow to the authority of Jesus. In Genesis 26:1, God told Isaac to remain in the land of farming and He (God) will bless him. Isaac did and the result is Genesis 26:12. As for us, and as citizens of Heaven, let us listen to our President, Jesus Christ, and whatever He tells us to do, let us do it. We shall not lack resources. Anyone who puts his\/her trust in God can never be put to shame. So, at His Word, you will be blessed. |"

      "message": "At creation in the Book of Genesis, death was not part of God's plan for man. Man did not fully appreciate this but the devil knew because theology reveals that Satan was an angel called lucipher before he rebelled against God, lost his position with God and was hurled down to the earth. And so, God decided to make man in His image to be like Him and to worship Him. God's plan for man was that he would be like and live like Him. This can be understood from Genesis 3:19, where God decreed hardship and death upon man and said: “By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat until you return to the ground from which you were made. For you were made from dust, and to dust you will return.” This is how man became a candidate of death because Satan does not want man to continue to worship God. The death was both physical and eternal death. The eternal being separation of man from God and the physical being the loss of life. And because God is merciful He gave us Jesus to die as sacrifice for our sin that brought about the two types of death. Jesus also rose from the dead so that when the physical death happens to anyone in Christ, hope is not totally lost. He translates to eternal life with God.  |But, even with the curse of death, God's intention is not that man should die young or prematurely, but to live till very old age, fulfilling destiny that will become a testimony for others to follow and live by the Word and also declare God's Work. This is buttressed by the scripture that says Exodus 23:26 that: “In your land no woman will have a miscarriage or be without children. I will give you long lives. But satan continues to cut short the lives of man by entering into other men to work against God and perpetrate all manners of evils just to cut short the lives of the elect. In Job 2:6, we see how God ensured that Satan did not kill Job, even though He permitted Satan to afflict him.  |However, since the giving Christ to die for man, so that when man leaves this evil and sinful world by death, this will be gain to man, as written in Philippians 1:21, that: “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” Therefore, when a child of God dies, it is gain to him\/her as there is rejoicing in heaven for the safe return home of a saint.  |Now, in our main text today, we see the declaration of David the writer of the Psalm, where he firmly stated that “ I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. Brethren, this should be our daily confession to drum it physically and spiritually into the ears of Satan and his human agents that by reason of our confidence in God, they cannot succeed in cutting short our lives. The psalmist was confident that God would keep him from death in the crisis that he was going through. And God did it. Charles Spurgeon, quoting Matthesius, revealed that Psalm 118:17 was also very precious to Martin Luther, when he faced threats on his life due to his reformation efforts. Spurgeon says that: According to Matthesius, Luther had this verse written against his study wall. |Brethren, we all know that the Word of God is true, it is real and it is life, but we must declare it, have it written boldly in our hearts, study or wherever for Satan and his angels to see that no matter their plans or schemes, they will not succeed in cutting short our lives. The Almighty God in fact tells us in His Word that He will do to us the things that He hears us say.  |In this dispensation of the whole world that evil abounds everywhere, as children of God, we must emphatically stand our grounds on and keep declaring the Word of God against satanic invasions on our lives. By the Power and mercy of God, we shall not die but live to declare the Word of God, and top it up always with Psalm 91:16 that: “With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.”  |"

In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” |In our main text of today, Hagar experienced a very hard time when suddenly she and her child were throne out of their home by the only father figure in their lives.

And the only thing she could do is to sit and watch her child about to die from hunger. Hagar's problem started when at a time of family celebration, she faced disappointment with Sarah. Although Hagar was a slave girl, Sarah must have in the first place, either pleaded with or commanded Hagar to sleep with her husband and bare a child for them. The same Sarah now turns around to ask that they be thrown out of the family. What could be more devastating?  |As if that was not enough, she had to face the shock of Abraham not standing up for his son but would rather throw him out. And so, she and her son Ismael, found themselves in the wilderness with no food, no water and no help from anyone. Brethren, your difficult time may not be like that of Hagar. You could be going through very difficult health issue, sickness, disease or infirmity like the woman with the issue of blood in Matthew 9:20. Different people go through diverse difficult times which could range from going through a divorce, having constant problems with your spouse, loss or lack of job, death of a loved one like when Jacob lost his wife Rachel during child birth in Genesis 35:15-20;  a bad downturn in business or even as it is today, with almost everyone in the world going through hard times economically and financially; just as it happened to the widow of zarephath in 1 Kings 17:10 or like the time of the great famine in Samaria as recorded in 2 kings 6:25-31.  |Whatever may be the difficult times that everyone is passing through, the common factor is that it always presents a situation of no help, no way forward and no solution. But whatever may be anyone's difficult time right now, and which might not be even listed here, the Lord knows, and He will come forth for you, show Himself strong, bring solution beyond your imagination and grant you victory, if only we would look away from the problem and look to the God with the perfect solution. This is because hard times are the times when our vision are blurry, we become very frustrated, like it was with Hagar. And when frustration sets in, we will begin to see almost everybody as our enemies. And example is the situation of Rachel in Gen 30:1-2 when Rachel was blaming her husband, Jacob for her childlessness. Our vision also become blurry and we cannot even see the way out of problem like Hagar who couldn't see the well of water by her side in Genesis 21: 14 - 18. Hard times are the times when our flesh is weakest and sickly like it was with Ishmael in our text today. Hard times are the times of sadness and unhappiness in a greater dimension as we see in Nehemiah 2:1-2, and prayerlessness and powerlessness set in. |Brethren, at such times when we are not able to pray, is the time to cry to God just as the Bible says in Genesis 21:17 that it was the cry of Ishmael that God heard. God will always hear the cry of His children. This is what the Bible says in Isaiah 49:15, and Isaiah 58:9. Brethren, we all are going through different levels of hard times, but when times are hard, even for the child that is crying, the cry of  the child always triggers the attention of the mother. Today, our cry to God will trigger the attention of God to our situations and we will have relief, even beyond that of Hagar, because of the covenant of the Blood of Jesus. |"

      "message": "The third formula that the Almighty and the All knowing God lays down for our good success is to “Keep doing what the Word of God says”; which simply means to live a life of obedience to the Word. However, the challenge of obedience in the lives of believers is not borne out of lack of knowing but the disregard that believers have for obedience because of the era of grace that all believers now enjoy and which the believers unfortunately now abuse. In our text today, Apostle James says that we should: “…be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.” And this we can only do when we totally surrender our hearts to God. |When one's heart is totally surrendered to God, you are more able to obey God. The contrast between the obedient heart and the disobedient one is typified by the lives of  king Saul and king David in the Old Testament. The Lord said David would be king because he had a heart after His own heart, a heart that would do all His will (1 Samuel 13:14a). King David's heart was God-centered and dependent on the Lord in contrast to the heart of king Saul. Prophet Samuel scolded Saul for his self-will and pride. Prophet Samuel noted that Saul only obeyed to be seen by the people, not because his heart was right with God. Prophet Samuel said of Saul, that Saul, has not kept that which the LORD commanded him (1 Samuel 13:14b). |In our today's main text, Apostle James writes that those who put the Word of God into practice will be blessed by God in what they do. We all want to prosper in the things we lay our hands to do. That is blessing. Which means, our blessing (successes) are tied to obedience to God in the way we live our lives. Our Lord Jesus Christ also tells us in John 14:15 that “If you love me, you will obey my commandments.” This means that our obedience to the Word of God will largely depend on our love for God. It is common for humans to obey the people that they love. So, to obey God, we must first truly love God; then we can obey Him seamlessly. This is the formula of God for man's good success. A success that has no fear attached to it. In the same John 14:16-17a, Jesus says further that: “I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, who will stay with you for ever. He is the Spirit who reveals the truth about God…” Too many things from the devil surround human beings (believers in particular), to make them not to be able to walk in total obedience to the Word of God. This is why we need the help of the Holy Spirit. Apostle Paul made a profound confession of weakness of man in Romans 7:19-20 that: “…I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.” Everyone is prone to disobedience because our forefather and foremother Adam and Eve disobeyed God, as such the seed of disobedience is in man. But when the Holy Spirit takes over, the Spirit of disobedience jumps out of man. God desires that we have success and a good one, but it is tied to our obedience to the Word of God.  |Brethren, this is the essence of our need for the Holy Spirit. It is only the Holy Spirit of God that can empower man to be obedient. Adam and Eve had the physical presence of God with them, yet they disobeyed. We cannot do it on ourselves, although we all desire to have good success. We therefore need to ask for the Holy Spirit's power and enablement for us to study the Word, meditate on it and be able to do according to the Word so that we will be blessed by God in all that we do and we can succeed. May we have good success in Jesus name.  |"

      "message": "The second formula which God lays down for man to succeed and in fact, not just succeed but to have good success, is to keep meditating on the Word of God. In our text today, Jesus was addressing the Pharisees on the sabbath controversy, as they could not understand Jesus or His teaching. Jesus made them to know that whatever a man says is determined by what fills the man's heart. A Chinese Philosopher by name, Lao-Tze on made a profound statement about how the thoughts of man translate into Destiny. And his statement became a saying that: \"Watch your thoughts; they become words, watch your words; they become actions, watch your actions; they become habits, watch your habits; they become character, watch your character; it becomes your destiny.\" |The Words of a man come from the heart, as Jesus says. God also says that what a man says is what He will do for man. And because God is righteous and cannot be faulted, having given man the first formula of making His Word our word, He also makes us to know that our mouth will only confess what we have filled our hearts with. And so that we can fill our hearts with positive thoughts no matter the situation, He says the second formula is to meditate on His Word so that our thoughts can be pure and positive, and thus, our confessions as well. This is why the Psalmist wrote that: “Your word I have hid in my heart, that I might not sin against You” (Psalms 119:11). In this life, the physical war is most inconsequential to the spiritual war, because the Spirit controls the physical. And so, God's Word, Jesus, says they are life and spirit, while the flesh (anything we say from a fleshy perspective) can do nothing. That is why, in a physical battle, the one that threatens fire and brimstone in physical ends up being the loser. But because the Word of God is Spirit, when we use it, we can never lose any battle. Apostle Paul also reveals this in Ephesians 6:12 that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. And in verse 17, he mentioned that the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. But if we do not meditate on it, we will not know the Word to use when the enemy comes.  |Nations go into battle prepared; they do not look for weapon when in battle, but fill their armoury with weapons ready for any battle. As such, meditating on the Word of God is the time that we spend filling armoury (our hearts) with God's Word. Therefore, for us as believers of today, the Word of God not only keeps us from sin, it is fire in our mouth to destroy every plan of the enemy by His Word. But it is only the Word that we know that we can make use of. Brethren, whatever may be our challenges, the Word of God is our weapon to overcome them. But we must meditate on it and as we meditate on it, we fill our hearts with it and it becomes our confession. Hebrew 4:12 says that \"the word of God is alive and active. sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.”  |Let us meditate on God's Word constantly so that as it stays in our hearts it becomes the Word in our mouth and our confessions will never be negative but positive and so we will surround our lives and the lives of our loved ones with only positivity. God's second formula for success is to meditate on the Word of God. Do it, and it will work for your good success."

      "message": "There is no human being in his\/her right senses that would not want to succeed in life. Amazingly, it is also the will of God that man succeeds in his life time on earth. Hence, His Word tells us that: “The Lord will guarantee a blessing on everything you do and will fill your storehouses with grain.\" Unfortunately, not everyone records success and often times, not for any fault of theirs nor deliberate intention of anyone, but because of lack of knowledge. (Hosea 4:6). And so the answer to lack of success with a lot of people is supplied in our main text today, where the Lord, through Joshua reveals the formula for success. |Through Joshua, God reveals what man has to do to guarantee his\/her success as follows:  |1. Keep speaking the Word of God  |2. Keep meditating on the Word of God  |3. Keep doing what the Word of God says  |4. Then you will prosper in your way  |5. You Will have good success. This is what God's word says to us on how to be successful. |We shall be looking at each step that God lays down for the success of man. The first being God's Word never departing from our mouth. This means in every situation, it is what God says that we must always make our confession. More often than not, the problems and challenges of man starts from what they confess over that man as far back as from the womb of his\/her mother, followed by what he\/she confess over him\/herself at different times. The Word of God warns us about what we say when the wise king writes in proverbs that: “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it and indulge it will eat its fruit and bear the consequences of their words” (Proverbs 18:21). When a man plants corn there's no way he will harvest rice. So, if a woman is pregnant in a way that she never planned for and upon being told she's pregnant; she or the man that makes her pregnant without being prepared to father a child say things like: “what kind of pregnancy of harbinger of misfortune is this?” Either of the two parents or even both of them have just decreed upon that innocent child that he\/she is coming into a life of misfortune. Another example is when one has a health challenge that seems to reoccur, rather than pray, you hear some people asking if it is not the sickness that will kill them. They might have just told the demonic world to see to their death through the sickness. This is because in this world of humans, only two spirits are in control i.e., the Spirit of God and evil spirit and man itself is a Spirit being. So when man speaks, the two spirits know who of them is being invoked and they start to operate. It would appear that the unbelievers understand this principle more than believers, hence you hear them say that negative confessions can't be heard from traditionalist. |Brethren, the Word of God actually tells us the instructions of Moses and Aron to the children of Israel in Numbers 14:26 & 28 that: “The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, Say to them, 'As I live,' says the Lord, 'just what you have spoken in My hearing I will most certainly do to you;” And this is why the Book of Proverbs (supra) warns us about our confession when it says that everyone will eat the fruit of what they say and also bear the consequences of their words. |The Almighty God thus plays the first step to success in our mouth. Jesus says in John 6:63 that: “It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh conveys no benefit [it is of no account]. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life [providing eternal life].” If Jesus' Words are spirit and life, the same goes for everyone. And the spirit controls the physical, that's why Jesus made it clear that the flesh which we see in the physical conveys no benefit. Therefore, no matter how difficult things are for any man, if by the Word the mouth, his\/her parents or even the person themselves have spoken positive words of success into the life of that person, that word is a seed which will germinate and come to realities. And even devil cannot stop it. Because God already says He will do what we say to His hearing. Unfortunately if the word spoken is a seed of failure sown, the same principle will apply because God does not break His own Word. |Brethren, God's formula for success is our guarantee for good success and prosperity but it starts with our confessions over every situation. But there's Good News for everyone who has made negative confessions about their children or themselves in the past. This is why God gave us Jesus and this is part of what the Blood of Jesus can do for us - to uproot every negative plant and cancel everything negative word. Hence Jesus says in Matthew 15:13 that: “…Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.” All you need do is to call on Jesus to be your Lord and Saviour and then by His Word and Blood, cancel every negative word spoken into or over your life and begin to confess the word of God on your life and destiny. The formula for success starts with our confessions therefore, let us mind our Words."

      "message": "The Almighty God has always being the God of surprises. When Jesus walked the surface of this earth, He constantly surprised His followers and God wants to do the same for you and for all His children, who have come to Him through Jesus. He wants to surprise us in every area of our lives. There are numerous ways in which God surprised the people of old in both the Old and the New Testaments of the Bible. Our text today is one of those great surprises of God. The most amazing of God's surprises for His children comes when the children of God are being attacked by the enemy. And even, when the attacks are justified or partly justified, or when we come under attack from people we do not know as King David says, in Psalm 54:3 that 'strangers are attacking me.' God is about to bring amazing surprises to our lives and destiny. |In the case of Moses in Exodus 3:2, the surprise of God came to him when he ran away from Egypt after being attacked by the Israelites whom he was defending as we can see in Exodus 2:11-16. Moses was now a grown up man and already known himself as an Hebrew. He was going round when he saw an Egyptian fighting a Hebrew, (His own kinsman). So Moses killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand. The following day, going round again, He saw two Hebrew men fighting and he tried to mediate between them, but he was verbally attacked and even asked if he wanted to kill them as he killed the Egyptian. This scared Moses. And even when the king heard about what had happened, he tried to have Moses killed, and so Moses fled and went to live in the land of Midian. Even though the attack of the Hebrews was not justified, the king  seeking to kill Moses was justified because Moses had committed a murder, and so he had to flee into exile. And, it was during this self exile that God's surprise came to Moses. I pray that whatever might be your wrong action, error or mistake, as long as you have taken refuge in God, He is going to surprise you in Jesus name. As Moses' life experienced the most amazing and unbelievable unusual and unexpected thing i.e., the bush was burning but it was not consumed, the Lord that you have taken refuge in despite your failure, is going to surprise you beyond human understanding in Jesus name.  |In the euphoria of the surprise that Moses was trying to take in, another amazing surprise came to Moses as the voice of God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. Let us Imagine watching something with amazement, and whilst still wondering how can this be, suddenly you hear your name called out from the midst of the unusual thing. That was an unbelievable surprise. Remember that there's no record of Moses hearing the voice of God prior to the burning bush. This is how amazing God can be with His surprises for His children. I pray that by God's providence, in the situation that you are in, and in the same situation that has turned your family and friends against you, the voice of God will come to you to make you a wonder to all those that hate you or have attacked you in Jesus name. So, we see that even when attacks against us are justified, we only need to turn to God. Today, whatever may be plaguing your life and which you think is justified because of your mistakes the Lord will surprise you for His name's sake and give you that which you have asked Him and much more, for His own Glory in Jesus name. God is about to surprise you. |"

      "message": "One of the ways that the surprises of the Almighty God comes to man is through the manifestation of His glory in the situation of His children and in whatever situation they are going through. When God's glory is manifested, the power of His glory turns things around and brings about dumbfounding miracles and breakthroughs that are unimaginable; all for His namesake. In our text today, the Bible makes us to know that to believe God is the first pre-condition for us to see the manifestation of His glory. When we believe God and we don't doubt in anyway, He will surprise us the same way that He did to Moses at the Burning Bush, to the children of Israel at the Red Sea, and to Abraham and Sarah with the birth of Isaac at a time of their very very old ages, particularly Sarah's age, and when it had ceased to be with her after the manner of women. (See Genesis 18:11). |Looking through the the New Testament again, we see the seventy disciples that Jesus sent out in Luke chapter 10. They all came back expressing their surprise that the spirits were cast out in Jesus Name. (See Luke 10:17). Also, on the Red Sea account in the Old Testament, when the children of Israel got to the Red Sea and with Pharaoh and the Egyptian chariots right behind them, they had concluded that God had abandoned them and the end had come. We can say that this is so because at that time, there was no record that any of the Israelites knew how to swim. They have been in slavery for over 400 years. However, the God of surprises showed Himself mighty. The Bible says: “Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided”(Exodus 14:21). In fact, God had said to Moses that,- “...the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I have gained my honor because of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”(Exodus 14:18). And indeed, He did. |Coming back to the main text of today, taken from John chapter 11. Standing at the tomb of Lazarus, Mary had given up hope. As far as Mary was concerned, by the time Jesus arrived, Lazarus fate had been sealed. It was already a forgone conclusion because Lazarus had been dead for 4 days. But, when Jesus appeared, God manifested  His Glory and everyone one, including those that later heard were also surprised. |Today, whatever is plaguing your life as a child of God, or the lives of your family members, and it looks to man that there is no solution in sight, and the enemy wants you to think that he has the upper hand or making you to think that your prayers are not reaching God; the Almighty is saying to you that Satan, your arch-enemy, will know that the Lord is your God and He will manifest His Glory in your life and situation for His namesake. And just as the chariots and horsemen of Pharaoh were drowned in the Red Sea, the spiritual Egyptian Chariots and horse men against your miracle will be drowned by the blood of Jesus, in Jesus name. As Lazarus resurrected after 4 days of his death, God's glory will manifest in your situation and your long expected miracle will come forth in Jesus name. You only need to believe and you will see the glory of God and God will surprise you. |"

      "bibleRef": "“So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, will be like a wise man [a far-sighted, practical, and sensible man] who built his house on the rock” (Matthew 7:24 AMP).",
      "message": "In the world today, too many things have gone wrong with homes. And it is like it is getting more difficult for people to have successful homes. Marriages are breaking in almost unprecedented rates, children are becoming more disobedient and uncaring and self-centred. Husbands are failing in their roles, wives would call their Pastors daddy and disrespect their husbands. Too many distractions around our lives as children of God. All these are happening because Satan is on the rage to distract people, make their lives miserable on earth and lead them to hell. This will not be our portion and will not be the portion of our children in Jesus name.  |However, in our text today, Jesus likens the one who hears His word and does it to the wise man that builds his house on the rock. In verse 25, He says: “And the rain fell, and the floods and torrents came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.” Building of the home begins the very day couples tie the knots of marriage. But it will certainly be hit by some challenges of life like the natural disasters that Jesus mentioned, but which could not bring down the house that is built on a rock. This natural disasters are synonymous with the challenges of life that confronts us as individuals and also as a family (the home). |The illustration of the two builders, show that each house may look the same from the outside, but from within (the foundation) there is a lot of differences. Even though the difference does not show from the outside, but the storm, rain and flood that will come, will prove the strength and quality of each house. It is the same for the foundation of our lives and also the homes we build. On what is our life built? If built on His word, then when the storm (challenges of life come) the life built on the word of God will stand firm but the one that is not will certainly reveal the stuff it is made of when it starts to crumble. |Brethren, there is no way challenges will not come against individuals and even against the family that makes the home, just as rains will come and there will be storms and flood. Life itself is a challenge. Men of old faced challenges. Families of old also faced challenges. But the ones that had God as their foundation stood firm. Examples are Abraham and Sarah, Samson, Saul, Judas, etc. Abraham heard and trusted the word of God, and though it tarried, but Isaac came. Samson did not allow God's word to rule his life, hence Delilah brought him down. Saul would not humble himself to go back to God but rather to a witch, hence he couldn't come to repentance. And same for Judas who would rather regret than repent and so he committed suicide. David on his part relied on the word of God, and though he did despicable things, but He went to God, repented and obtained mercy and became a man after God's heart. It is only the word that can give us victory in this world and Jesus is the Word of God. We must build our lives on Him.  |It is individuals that come together in marriage to build a home. Therefore, to build a successful home, we must also build same on the principles of God, not on human principles. God has to be the foundation of each home so that when the storms of life come the family will have one focus - “God” and they will overcome as they stand firm on His word. In Colossians 3:12-23, these principles are clearly laid out for us; and Vs.23 concludes that: “…whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;” Isaiah 32:18 says: \"My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.\" This is the plan of God for each home - to be secured and peaceful. Also, God says in Isaiah 28:16 that “I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation; Whoever believes will not act hastily.” This sure foundation is Jesus Christ, the Word of God. |Therefore, it is important to live our lives and run our homes on the principle that is higher than our circumstances - the principle of God, so that our homes will stand in times of storm. |In Genesis God said of Abraham that: “For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD…” (Genesis 18:19). We too must keep the way of the Lord, and teach our children as well. This way is Jesus - John 14:6. As we do, and also live prayerful lives, we will have successful homes, and our children will do too. The Spirit of God will empower us and by the mercy of God, we will have successful homes in Jesus name. |"

This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.” |Brethren, no matter what your situation is, once you have been redeemed through the blood of Jesus, you have become God's child through Christ. God sees you as His perfect and precious child. He is proud of you. You are the joy of His heart. This is why He says in our text today that He has compassion for us just as a father does his children.  |No doubt that we sometimes make mistakes; sometimes we even fail Him, we even mess up, but even at that, God does not stop loving us. This is why Jesus says in Luke 5:32 that He did not come for the righteous. If God sent Jesus to die for us when we have not known Him, we can only imagine the love He will shower on us as His children. So that even when we mess up, He cleans off the mess and calms our soul. In His eyes, we are the overcomer; we are victorious; we are strong. In His eyes, through the Blood of Jesus, we are pure and whole.  |Today, Brethren, wherever you think you have gone wrong or blown it, it's not hidden from God. He saw the pit before you fell. He does not leave you to fall but it's we who were not attentive to Him. He also saw the mess before you messed up. But He will always turn the situation around. All that God is waiting for now is that every child turns back to Him. His unfailing arm of love is wide open to take you up and turn your mess to His mercy, and turn your poor situation to His power. Let us confess whatever is our situation to Him and turn away from every sin. He has provided mercy for us in the blood of Jesus. And He sees us through the blood of Jesus. As such, in His eyes we are not just precious but bundle of testimonies to draw others to Him. This is why Peter concluded that: we “…should shew forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light”  |Whatever you might have done wrong, don't live in regret like Judas, only repent of all wrong steps, turn away from them and take on the new life in Jesus Christ because in God's own eyes, you are His precious child made made whole through the blood of Jesus. Therefore, begin to see yourself from God's own eyes. |"

      "message": "Brethren, still on claiming the promises of God and rejecting the lies of Satan. In our text today, the Psalmist enjoins us to wait on the Lord and be of good courage. Waiting on the Lord simply means continuing in trusting the Lord no matter how long we have to wait. It is a question of trust. The truth of the Word of God and its sacrosanct is what Satan also knows. But because he wants to steal a man's worship of God for himself, he will tell all manner of lies using those around us - families, friends, doctors, mentors and even the thoughts of our own minds etc. to suggest to us that there is no way out or there is no solution anymore. This is why Apostle Paul calls us to cast down every imagination to the obedience of God (2 Corinthians 10:5).  |Are you facing oppression? God's word in Psalm 146:6-7 says that He will deliver us and that He keeps His promises. God did not only deliver Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego from the oppression of the king of Babylon, He also honored all these Hebrew boys. (Daniel chapters 3 and 6). The Psalmist breaks the backbone of the lies of Satan in Psalm 84:11 that the LORD God is our sun and our shield, that God will give grace and glory; and no good thing will He withhold from us when we walk uprightly. When one turns to believe the deception of Satan as against God's Word, just as the first Adam did, then such a person makes God a liar and by so doing, they will not be walking uprightly; thereby allowing the devil to rob them of their desired blessings and miracles. This will not be our portion.  |In the Scriptures we read of the man that was born blind, he met Jesus and he got new set of eyes (John 9:1-7). Also, Hannah never gave up hope that God would hear her prayer (1 Samuel 1:1-28). She got Samuel and also had three more sons (1 Samuel 2:21). Joseph's brothers bowed down to him as God had showed him in his dream (Genesis 42:5-7). Jesus resurrected as He promised (Mark 9:31; Mathew 28:6.). Joshua said in his valedictory speech to the Israelites in Joshua 21:45 that: “Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.“ |Brethren, what are you trusting God for? Look for His Word that meets your need, stand on it and claim it daily. God promised in Habakkuk 2:3 that every promise is for an appointed time, but however long it takes, at the end it will speak, and it will not fail. Even though it tarries, we have to wait for it; because His Word will surely come to pass and it won't be long. Hallelujah! So, brethren whatever may be your situation or challenge or need, you must reject every lie of the devil and stand on God's promises. None of His promises will fail in Jesus name."

      "message": "In every difficult situation that man finds himself or herself, God is ever ready to help man out. All He is waiting for is for man to recognize His need for God and call on Him. Hence, God's word reveals to us His many promises. One of such promises is today's main text that “I will help you”. And so, May be on your path right now, you are facing what seems to be a tough opposition. The first thing that usually comes to man is the lie of Satan that “you are stuck”. Brethren, at such times, just trust God and keep on moving in faith, God's promise is that He will make a way in the wilderness, and river in the desert. (Isaiah 43:19b.) God also says in Isaiah 41:17 that: When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.” We all are needy at some point or the other. And He says, He will hear. For God to hear, we too have to call. Therefore, in times of your need, reject the lie of the devil that there's no way out for you, call on God and and claim His promises over your situation. You will be amazed at God's power of providence. |Do you have delay in child bearing or a kind of suspense after your first child and there is an unpalatable medical report? (God bless all Doctors). However, the Word of God says in Exodus 23:26 that: None shall be barren in your land. Also, in Psalm 128:3, His Word is that your wife will be fruitful and your children will surround your table. It's time to Stand on these promises and reject Satan's lies, however convincing it looks. Appearance is not always the reality. It is often Satan's deception.  |Stand Firm on God's Word. God promises to watch over His Word to perform it (Jeremiah 1:12). Often times, Satan will also say that you have waited for so long, nothing has happened and at your age, nothing can happen anymore. Brothers and sisters, at such times remember that God has countered this lie with His Word that: “one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” (2 Peter 3:8). Jesus also made it clear that: “…until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God's law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.” (Matthew 5:18). Therefore, no man's age is the deciding factor. But God is. If He says it, He will surely do it. Hence He as the Father declares that His Word will not return to Him void (Isaiah 55:11). And, Jesus also says that Nothing is impossible with God (Luke 1:37 and Matthew 19:26). The Almighty God further asks all who would care to read His Word in Jeremiah 32:27 that: “I am the Lord, the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too hard for me?” Nothing is hard for God to do. Brethren, today take your challenges to God, call on Him and reject the lie of Satan and it shall be well with you. |"

      "message": "In the text above, Jesus speaking to the Pharisees says that satan is a liar and the father of all lies and that there is no truth in him. Satan does not lie to himself but to humans. He knows the truth, but he can no longer follow the truth, as such he does not want any man to follow the truth just to prevent him from glorifying God. And so today, we are looking at the many ways that Satan lies to man as against the promises of God, so that man will believe satan's lies and disbelieve God. Unfortunately, these lies of Satan have never changed one dot of the truth of the Word of God and it can never change it. |There is no doubt that life is full of challenges. Challenges of life became part of man and in fact a curse because the first man chose to disbelief God and acted on the lie of the serpent (the devil). But because God loves man so much, (John 3:16), God made a way for man out of all these challenges through the promise of His Son. God kept that great promise and so the believers have the benefit of becoming God's children. But the serpent still continues with his lies so that man can again turn away from God. But by the power of the Holy Spirit, man is empowered to stand on God's truth and reject all Satan's lies. Let us look at some examples of God's promises that Satan does not want man believe. |Starting with forgiveness. God's Word says in 1 John 1:9 that: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” But because Satan can no longer come to repentance nor be forgiven, he will tell man that their sins are too great, too much or too bad or too big for God to forgive, so that man will die in sin. The truth of the Word of God is just confess, repent and you are forgiven. God is merciful, He does not lie. He sacrificed the life of Jesus for our sins. Jesus died to reconcile man to God. John 3:16 is our anchor. So claim the promise of God and live the life of a forgiven child of God like the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-32 |May be you have a health challenge and the report of the Doctor is not encouraging(God bless all the doctors), God the Almighty God in His mercy will restore your health. The Word of God says in Exodus 15:26 that He is the Lord that heals and Jeremiah 33:6 says that He will bring health and healing. As children of God, we must always do the right things, eat the right food and claim the promise of God, healing is guaranteed and Satan's lies will fail. God says in Genesis 1;29 that: “Then God said, “Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food.” May you receive the empowerment of the Holy Spirit to claim God's promises over your life and health challenges, it will work for you in Jesus name."

      "message": "In Matthew 28:1-10, the Bible reveals the victory that followed the silent Sabbath. That very early in the morning, on the first day of the week (which is Sunday), Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. Remember that these two women stood in front of the tomb looking at it after Jesus was laid in it on Friday (in utter disbelief of Jesus' death). But on getting there after sabbath which kept them at home, they were greeted by the news of “He has risen, just as He said He would” |The Bible reveals further to us that there had been a great earthquake and, an angel of God had descended from heaven and rolled away the stone from the tomb, and sat on it. Also we are told that the appearance of the angel was like lightning, and his clothes as white as snow. So much that the guards shook, and paralyzed with fear at the sight and they became like dead men i.e. totally immobilized. And when the women got there, the angel told them not to be afraid, that Jesus is no longer there; He has risen, just as He said.  |Brethren, our Lord and Saviour is risen. Death did not have the victory; Jesus had and still has the Victory. Jesus' resurrection is the proof that He is whom He said He is. He is Lord. He is Saviour! He is Healer! He is the Coming King, hallelujah!  |The truth of the resurrection Sunday is that death was totally defeated, Jesus paid the price, therefore total forgiveness is possible for all who believe and trust in Jesus and accept Him as Lord and Saviour. |Brethren, do you understand who Jesus is? He alone said: “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavily burdened and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). Are you in any situation that makes you burdened? Are you in a Situation that is beyond human solution? A situation that presents itself as no more solution? May be doctors have told you that there's no medical science to help anymore. May be you have labored and toiled and the more you work hard, the more it looks like there's no way out of debt. Is your loved one or child that is giving you concern or sleepless nights?  |Remember that Mary Magdalene and the other Mary stood in front of the tomb on Friday evening and it was a situation of “Wow! Jesus has died”. No way out anymore! And they too must have had sleepless night from Friday night as they both went home downcast. On the whole of sabbath, there was dead silence. They could not think of anyway out anymore! But the morning of first day of the week, even before dawn brought the news of victory.  |Brethren, the situation that has presented itself to you as no way out can be likened to the silence of sabbath and so it's your own great silence period too. But as the news of victory and shouts of rejoicing took over the air, after the great silence of sabbath day, If you can turn to Christ and let Him deal with your situation, you have His guarantee and assurance that your shout of victory and sounds of rejoicing will surely manifest. Jesus' promises in John 14:1-14 remain unchanged. In verse 13, Jesus says: “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” Brethren, let us understand the love that Jesus has for us. Let us focus on what He endured for us to have victory. Let us turn to Him in total surrender. And He will see to how the shout of victory will manifest.  |If Jesus was willing to sacrifice Himself for our sins and for our salvation, no other thing can ever be more difficult for Him to do for us. All power in heaven and on earth has been given to Him. He is waiting for your total surrender and total reliance on Him, and by His Word, your situation of silence will be followed by shout of victory and noise of rejoicing in Jesus name."

      "message": "Victory is to overcome or win a competition, contest or struggle or to overcome an opponent, or difficult problem. Generally, victory does not just come to people. They have to fight for it. And it could be physical or spiritual fight or both. To have spiritual victory man has to wrestle with the devil. When God made man, He did not create man for battle but to live at peace and enjoy his life. Hence, God made available all the provisions for man before creating man and then locating man where the provision is. Unfortunately, man lost all these life of freedom from struggle when man listened to God's number one enemy, Satan. God chased man out of the Garden of Eden, and placed a curse on man to labour before he can eat and also on the woman to also labour before she bring forth children. But God being a merciful God, gave Himself through Christ to die for the sins of man in order to reconcile man to Himself.  |But Satan would still do all he can to prevent man from succeeding in life. And that is the source of battle for man's destiny and success. It is a battle from the spiritual realm before it manifests in the physical realm (Ephesians 6:12). This is why we can only be strong in the power of God's might and we must take up the whole amour of God (Ephesians 6:10-11). Satan can never overcome God, and so, a man that will overcome Satan must call on God and hold firm unto God the source of both spiritual and physical victory. However, victory is still not automatically given, we have to fight for it. And because man does not have the capacity to fight Satan on their own, man needs God to be able to overcome Satan. Therefore, God is the only source of man's victory over Satan. Hence, our text today written by Apostle Paul to the Christians in Corinth confirms that it is God that gives us victory through Christ.  |Brethren, for God to give us victory, we need to abide in Christ and live continually in Him in order to live a continuous life of victory. And, victory comes because God is with us. The bible teaches us that we have already been given the victory as written in 1 John 5:4 that: “For everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.” |So, running away from victory means to run away from God by refusing to accept Christ as the only source of victory. The children of Israel had victory over Pharaoh only through God, same for Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Samson left God and clung to strange women, and so he lost his source of strength. Although he called on God and God restored his strength and he was able to destroy his enemies but he also died with them. This will not be our portion. |The Psalmist says: “With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies” (Psalms 108:13 NIV). If it is with God that we will gain victory, then it will be foolhardy for man to think that they can live their lives and do their things without God. This is why the Bible makes it clear that through Christ we can do all things, because it is He who gives us strength (Philippians 4:13).  |Brethren, the life we are living is a life of battle. God does not want us to become either spiritual or physical casualties in the battle field of destiny. Therefore, let us hold on to God like never before. And if anyone is not in genuine relationship with God, please run back to Him. He is the God of battle that has never lost any battle and He can never lose any one. The resurrection and victory of Jesus Christ over the devil, death and the grave that is being remembered and celebrated all over the world today should give us confidence that whatever battle we face, we will surely be victorious as you remain in God and in Christ's victory. To run away from God is to run away from victory. May we not run away from Christ's victory in Jesus name."

      "message": "Jesus says don't worry. There will be times of challenges. It is part of life. However, when such times come, we can always hold on to God's Word and trust Him. He is able to give us victory over every challenge. This is why in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in Matthew Chapter 6:25, He specifically says: “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?” |Jesus was on earth in human flesh, and so the Bible says: He knows our frame…” Psalm 103:14; and also in Hebrews 4:15 that: “Jesus, our high priest, is able to understand our weaknesses. When Jesus lived on earth, He was tempted in every way. He was tempted in the same ways we are tempted, but He never sinned.” So, He that knows our frame, knows our challenges and also sympathizes with us says: “Do not worry”. It means that there is assurance of victory no matter what we face. We only need to stay on the right track with God. |Why would Jesus say do not worry? One of the answers is in Jeremiah 29:10-11 where the word of God says: “Babylon will be powerful for 70 years. After that time, I will come to you people who are living in Babylon. I will keep my good promise to bring you back to Jerusalem…I say this because I know the plans that I have for you.” This message is from the Lord. “I have good plans for you. I don't plan to hurt you. I plan to give you hope and a good future.” The time of challenges and difficulties in the life of any child of God is a time of captivity, just like the time that Israel was taken captive to Babylon. But God's promise to deliver them came to pass. He is still the same God. Hence, Jesus says, concerning your present challenges: “Don't worry!” However long it takes, God's plan for a good future will come to pass.  |Another reason that Jesus says “Do not worry” is because worry can rob us of happiness and joy as written in Proverbs 12:25. Therefore, in the letter of Apotle Peter, he encouraged us to surrender all our worries to God because He cares for us (1 Peter 5:7). There are countless examples of when the people of old or even the nation of Israel found themselves in the most terrifying challenge of their time; but God gave them victory because they trusted in God and His Word. See the Exodus of Israel from Egypt (Exodus 5-13), the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14-15), the Crossing of Jordan River (Deuteronomy 30:18-20); the bringing down of the Wall of Jericho (Joshua 6:1-27). Haman's hatred for Mordecai and his plan to annihilate Israel and the victory of Mordecai (Esther chapters 4-6). In all these, the children of God were the victors, never the vanquished. Just as Jesus says fear not, the word of Moses to the people of Israel was also “…Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD...” (Exodus 14:13)”.  |Brethren, humanity all over the world are in this present age faced with diverse challenges and very difficult times too, and these challenges do not exclude us as children of God. Be it economic, political, financial, inflation, lack of money, career or family issues, or even health challenges. We all are facing the same problems but in different ways. But the good news is that the Word of God to those who would trust Him is the assurance of His help and victory no matter how tough the situation may be. Hence in Isaiah 41:10 God says: “Do not be afraid, I am with you! I am your God, let nothing terrify you! I will make you strong and help you; I will protect you and save you.” (GNB). And in Isaiah 26:3 that God keeps in perfect peace those whose mind is rested on God because they trust in God. Therefore, for us as children of God, it is a matter of trust. Do you trust God? If Yes! Then, Do not worry about your present challenges. Only do the right thing as Jesus says in Matthew 6:33 - “Seek first the kingdom of God.” Then watch how God will turn your trials to testimonies and your mistake to His Mercy.  |Another reason that Jesus says don't worry is also found in Psalm 73. Where we can see that worrying will make one to focus on the wrong things which includes the prosperity of the wicked, and thereby think that the wicked ones are enjoying while the children of God are suffering. This is another serious  danger that comes with worrying. The Psalmist recognizes this when the Bible reveals how his mind was drifting away as recorded in Psalm 73 that: “….But I had nearly lost confidence; my faith was almost gone…because I was jealous of the proud when I saw that things go well for the wicked…until I went into your Temple. Then I understood what will happen to the wicked” (Vs 2-3, & 17 GNB). Therefore, whatever we are going through let us follow what Jesus says that: “Do not worry”. Your challenge or problem is only a passing phase and God has promised victory for those who would trust Him. As such, even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, for God is with us…(Psalms 23:4). God's Word is our everlasting strength.  Therefore, no matter the tough challenge, let the Word of Jesus be in the fore front of our minds that: “Do Not Worry” - about your life - about what you will eat or drink or what you will wear… Look at the birds of the air…your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? Therefore do not worry..For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.” (Matthew 6:25-32). Let us Trust Him. |"

      "message": "In our text today, Jesus calls our attention to how we speak to or speak about our fellow brother or sister. And, one of it is something that may appear not too serious but which Jesus says, can make one to be in danger of going to hell fire. In the previous verse, Jesus refers to the law against murder which is a very serious offense. But He then said that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of judgment. Jesus wants His listeners of that time and we as the believers of today to understand that although murder is very bad, but to think that any sin short of murder might be allowed or permitted is not how the kingdom of God works. Our Lord Jesus Christ makes it clear that it is not only those who commit murder that are in danger of judgment, but anyone with a murderous intent in his\/her heart is in danger as well. |The point here is that Jesus Christ is not saying that anger is as bad as murder in the secular world. But what He wants us to know is that the laws of the people could only deal with the outward act of murder, and so we must understood that God's morality addresses not only the end but also the beginning of murder. And with God sin is sin. Therefore Jesus refers to the danger of saying to a brother “Raca”, and calling a brother a fool to be a sin that can put one in danger of hell fire. |Bible commentary explains that to call someone “Raca” shows contempt for that person's intelligence. And that calling someone a fool shows a contempt for their character. This is where the danger lies for the believer because the Word of God tells us that everyone is created in the image of God. And so, whereas murder is a terrible sin, it is a sin that makes noise to the extent that the person is brought to quick judgment and in the moment of earthly judgment such a person may repent. But the sin of calling a fellow brother a fool or any other silent sin does not even count much in that no one considers it serious. But Jesus says it puts one in danger of hell fire. This is because sin is sin to God. No sin is greater. And every sin amounts to disobedience to God's word. |Brethren, Jesus Christ points this out so that His death and Resurrection, His Blood and the sacrifice of His life will not be in vain in the lives of the believers just because of some flimsy things in our lives while those who commit grave infraction like the thief on the cross and the woman caught in adultery (Luke 23:29-43 and John 8:1-11) will make heaven because they committed what are apparently grievous shouting sin, and they were punished and repented and found salvation. Typical example is Judas that walked with Jesus and missed it in the end because he committed a silent sin and rather than repent, he committed suicide. If only He had the grace to repent, He could have been forgiven because God is merciful. This is why the Songs of Solomon warns that we should: “Catch the foxes, the little foxes, before they ruin our vineyard in bloom.” (Song of Songs 2:15 GNB). The Bible says further that “All wrongdoing is sin...” (1 John 5:17a).  |Anger is as bad as murder because it can lead a careless believer to the wrong place if he\/she does not have the grace to repent before Jesus comes or sudden death comes calling. Lusting after another person's spouse is as bad as adultery by God's standard (Matthew 5:27-28). The lie we refer to as white lie, with God is the same with the big ones we spank our children for. All these are silent sins that believers have become complacent with and Jesus says they can lead one to hell fire. This is why we must ask for forgiveness of known and unknown sin every day of our lives until Jesus Comes.  |Brethren, the regulator of this world is satan and as much as possible he wants to stop man from making it to eternal life. I pray that neither you nor I nor any of our loved ones will be eternally dammed in Jesus name. Ephesians 4:26 says: “Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath,” Is there anyone that has wronged you, and you are still holding unto their offense. Please find it in your heart to forgive the person. Jesus can come anytime. Silent sin is dangerous. We will not miss heaven in Jesus name."

      "message": "The above word of God through Prophet Isaiah is simple and straightforward, saying: “if only…”. A lot of time we have found ourselves in situations when we made statements or lamentations like: “if only I knew”…, “if only I prepared” etc. If only is a lamentation of regret. In today's text, we can say that God is calling men to a state of looking back in their actions, words and or inactions to see that what they are going through is the consequences of their own actions which God's word had warned against, but which they did not heed. The King James Version says: “Oh, that you had heeded My commandments…”. This can only be in the light of God's power and love for Israel. God laments their unfulfilled potentials because they could not fulfil them because of their disobedience. God therefore says: If they had only obeyed, then their peace would have been like a river. That is peace that is flowing, peace that is bountiful, and peace that is life-giving like the river.  |Secondly, that If they had only obeyed, then their righteousness would have been like the waves of the sea. This means an unending and reliable righteousness that is certain just like the sea. Thirdly, that if only Israel had obeyed, their descendants would have been like the sand i.e., as numerous and as dense in population as the sand.  |As believers, a lot of the challenges we are facing and the battles we find ourselves in today are largely due to our own disobedience to God's commandments. When we consider carefully where we are and where we should have been, and we remember all our wrong turns and bends which were in outright disobedience to the Word of God that we know, and we realise how far we could have gone in fulfilling destiny and making it in life, “if only we obeyed God”, it must be sobering.  |Most of us have unfulfilled potentials through our disobedience or unbelief and these have kept us from everything that God has for us. But if we can go to God, and lay all the cards on His table, saying: “Lord, I confess that my disobedience to your Word, thinking I can do what I like has led me into all these unfulfilled potentials, I repent. Have mercy on me. God is merciful. He will forgive and restore us.  |Brethren, the saying goes that: Obedience is the first law of heaven, the cornerstone upon which all righteousness and progression rest. All that is required from a man to fulfil his destiny is to obey His Word because God knows that man has a contender, satan. It is satan that tempts man to disobey God. Jesus was also tempted by satan with the wealth of this earth if Jesus would bow to Him. (Matthew 4:7-10) Satan would tempt us to disobey God and promise to give us those things which are already in the plan of God for us. But whatever satan gives is counterfeit of what God has in plan for us. Jesus knew that everything consists in Him, including wealth - Colossians 1:16. Therefore, Jesus did not fall for the lie of satan.  |Every act of disobedience always ends in “if only”. God requires repentance so that He can restore us according to His promise in Joel 2:25 that: “I will give you back what you lost….” I pray that we and all our children will walk in obedience to the Word of God so that we can be restored to fulfillments of our potentials and destinies and God will have no regrets over us in Jesus name. By His Mercy, we will not end the journey of our lives with regrets in Jesus name."

      "message": "In continuation of the study of the three-fold ministry of Jesus, we have looked at the first two which are preaching and teaching; today, we are looking at the third, which is Healing. Our text in focus says: Jesus went about…Teaching, Preaching and Healing. The Bible also makes us to know that He was healing “ALL KINDS OF SICKNESS (ILLNESS) AND ALL KINDS OF DISEASES”. The difference between these two is that  “Illness is something that needs to be managed such as feelings of pain, discomfort, distress, weakness, fatigue, etc,…Disease is something that needs to be cured” Examples of Illness are Diarrhoea, Headache, Cold and Flu, Stomach pain, fever while Diseases include diabetes, kidney disease, leprosy, etc. But usually, diseases are said to be accompanied by illness. However, whichever it was, Jesus healed all. |Biblical examples of these two are (1) Simon Peter's mother-in-law that was very sick with a high fever and when Jesus got there, He healed her by ordering the sickness to go away, and the Bible says that the sickness left her, and she got up and began to serve them (Luke 4:38-40). While, in Luke 17:12-19, we have the account of the 10 Lepers that Jesus healed of their leprosy by simply telling them to go and show themselves to the Priest.  |The Bible also makes us to know that there is a general connection between sickness and sin. That death, disease, and decay were not part of God's original design for human beings. However, whatever it was that afflicted those that were brought to Jesus, we are told that they were all healed of their diverse sicknesses, ailments and infirmities. And all the four gospels revealed that Jesus supernaturally healed people to fulfil biblical prophecies. In Matthew 4:16-17, the Bible says that Jesus “When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses.” See also Isaiah 53:4. Jesus, by healing the people during His earthly ministry, fulfilled this particular prophecy by Isaiah. And no matter the cause of the sickness or disease, Jesus did heal all so that the people would know that their sins were forgiven (Mark 2:1-12). |Brethren, the ability of Jesus to heal those with all kinds of sicknesses and diseases shows that He alone has the power over the damage done to humanity by the fall of man because: He alone has authority over demons (and those who were demon-possessed). He alone has authority over death and hell. He alone has authentic power over all creation. Jesus says in John 6:63 that “…the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” John 1:1 also makes us to know that Jesus is the Word.  |Brethren, Jesus is the Word, therefore, as we teach Him (the Word) and preach Him (the Word), we are preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God and when people receive Him and turn away from their sins, they will receive salvation and take on the life of Christ and healing will take place, deliverance and freedom from oppression will come to them. Thereby, the tyranny of sin is broken by the Power of God. Brethren, the whole essence of Jesus' three-fold ministry is for us to tell the world around us that the kingdom of God can come to each life so that the Reign of Christ can begin in their lives and people are able to live the life that God planned for man from the beginning of creation.  |This same power, Jesus has given His followers, including today's true believers. This is why Jesus says that: “I am telling you the truth: those who believe in me will do what I do — yes, they will do even greater things, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask for in my name, so that the Father's glory will be shown through the Son.” (John 14:12-13).  |It is my prayer that we will fulfill the three-fold ministry of Jesus and manifest His power on earth so that we can populate the kingdom of God being the sole essence of the ministry of Jesus."

      "message": "Matthew Chapter 4 marks the beginning of Jesus' ministry. And, a lot of things can be learnt from this chapter about Jesus Christ and His ministry. Our text today reveals three major things about the ministry of Jesus and these are: Teaching, Preaching and Healing (vs.23). |We have looked at the preaching ministry last week amongst these three important things which I understand as the three-fold ministry of Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. |We will continue with another aspect of Jesus' ministry i.e. Teaching.  |The Bible says: “And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues…” (Vs.23).  |Teaching is defined as importation of knowledge or to instruct someone as to how to do something. May God bless all teachers at every level of learning and all parents who started the teaching of every one before they ever got to school. May we never reject being taught. Also, can we not say that the decadence in the world today is because the study of the scripture is lacking in the lives of many people. Hence the reason for the rise in moral decadence  as people live their lives on human principles and not godly principles. May God help humanity. The Scripture says that:  “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works” (2 Timothy 3:16-17). |In the time of Jesus, it was the custom of the Jews to go to the Synagogue not just to pray but to be taught in the scriptures. Jesus very much knew the importance of teaching and so it formed the folcrum of His ministry. The synagogue time therefore gave Jesus many opportunities to teach.  |One advantage of teaching is that there will always be time for questions and discussions for one to have better understanding of what is being taught. Unfortunately, during Jesus' time rather than asking useful questions, we find some people e.g., the Pharisees asking questions with very mischievous intentions to accuse Jesus of speaking against the law of Moses and have him arrested. But those who had genuine intention and love for the Word of God were blessed by the Word.  |Therefore, because the synagogue was the ideal place that people were taught the scriptures, it was those who want to learn more about the Word and the Law of God that would often go to the Synagogue. Do we have our own synagogue today? I answer affirmatively. Our synagogue is the Sunday (Bible) School and Bible Study time in every Bible believing church.  |Brethren, it is very important as believers that we make it a custom to attend the Sunday (Bible) School and Bible Study on Tuesday and also to ensure that our children are very much encouraged to attend as well. The Bible tells us that as a child at 12 years old, Jesus went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover with His parents as they normally do every year. But this time around, as they were returning from Jerusalem, Jesus went back to be taught in the scriptures. The scripture says that as they journeyed on and His parents suddenly realised that Jesus was not in the crowd so, they went back to look for Him only to find Him sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions (Luke 2:41-46). |Study of the Word is very important in the life of a believer and as we attend the Sunday (Bible) School and Bible Study, we must also encourage all our children to attend. One of the things that the Bible recognises about the importance of the scripture is it is for instruction (teaching) in righteousness because by those teachings, a man can be made thoroughly furnished for good works (2 Timothy 3:15-16). |Another thing that also stands out on the need to attend Bible Study is that at Bible Study, the miracle of healing can happen. The Bible reveals that when Jesus was on earth: “they brought to Jesus all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.” But apart from all those that were specifically brought to Jesus for healing, or even those that shouted to Jesus for healing like the Blind Bartimaeus in Mark 10: 46–52, the Bible also tells us of a particular woman who was attending the synagogue to be taught and there she got noticed by Jesus and she received her healing in Luke 13:10-17.  |Therefore, when we are committed to attend Bible Study, Jesus will notice us and miracles of those things that we desire or that plague our lives will receive the miraculous touch of God for instant healing just as He did notice the woman that was bent over for 18 years in Luke 13:10-17 which say that: “On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.” Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. Jesus gave attention to the bent over woman without her asking for it. The source of her miracle was her devotion to the Word and to be taught by Jesus. I pray that as we also diligently attend Bible Study in our church this year, Jesus will notice us and our lives and situations will be touched by the power of God in Jesus name.  |Brethren, there is power in the Word of God because Jesus Himself is the Word. Jesus (the Word) noticed this woman who came to be taught the Word (Jesus) and He (Jesus) noticed her, touched her and healed her. Is there anything that is plaguing your life? Go into the Word by creating a time for yourself to study it. And Jesus will attend to your situation because Jesus is the Word. In John 11:25 Jesus says to Martha that:  \"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall live”. If you believe in Jesus, devote your time to study the Word of God because He is the Word and as you diligently do, He will attend to the situation of your life and any situation that looks like a dead one i.e., hopeless shall receive the life of Christ and the miraculous will happen for God to be glorified in your life. I pray that as we show our love for the study of the Word, Jesus will notice us and attend to our most troubled situation and most desired needs, whether physical, material, spiritual or financial need in Jesus name. |"

      "message": "Preaching is the nucleus of Jesus' ministry as revealed in the text above. Jesus' ministry was all about the kingdom of God. Jesus preached the uncompromising proclamation of the certainties of God's kingdom. This is what every believer is expected to preach in their words and actions. It was the last commission that Jesus gave His followers, after His resurrection, when He says in Mark 16:15 that: “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.\"  |Jesus commands us as His followers to preach the Gospel of the kingdom of God. The question for us today is, “are we preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God or the gospel of prosperity?” Brethren, the gospel of the kingdom is the message of salvation proclaiming Christ who was born, crucified and resurrected for the salvation of man from sin. The Bible says that when Philip the evangelist preached “the good news about the kingdom of God,” men and women believed and were baptized (Acts 8:12). The gospel of the kingdom of God which John the Baptist preached in Matthew 3:2 is the same Gospel that Jesus Christ preached as recorded in Matthew 4:17, calling the people to “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” |This is what our Lord Jesus Christ has commissioned us to preach to the whole world and not prosperity gospel that people would prefer to listen to rather than the gospel of the kingdom of God. But you and I must preach nothing but the gospel of the kingdom of God. This is not to say that Jesus does not want us to prosper; far from it. The truth is that the message of the kingdom of God which leads to salvation also brings deliverance and healing; and ultimately prosper the lives of those who believe in Him. Hence Jesus says: “…do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear? But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (Matthew 6:31&33). Jesus says further that “…your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. (Matthew 6:32). |Brethren, the Gospel of the kingdom of God which Jesus commands us to preach calls the people to turn from their sin and live a holy life in God which ultimately will bring blessing into their lives. When the Apostles preached the same gospel, they also called people to turn from their sins, trust in Jesus Christ and begin a new life in Christ.  |Brethren, by the Spirit and Power of God and not human wisdom, there is a great certainty and a great confidence that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations. For, it is written in 1 Corinthians 2:4 that: “…my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”  |We all know that we do not all have to be in cassock to preach the kingdom of God, therefore in our little corners, our places of work or business and in our places of study, let us engage ourselves in Jesus' ministry of preaching the Good News of the kingdom of God. Let us jettison the fleshy ministry of what the flesh wants to hear, so that we can please our Heavenly Father. May we all fulfil the mandate of the great commission to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God which is the Good News of and New life in Christ this month and beyond in Jesus name. |"

      "message": "Today, we see in Psalm 91:5-6 another set of great benefits of dwelling in the secret place of the Most High. As of a truth, God did not promise man, particularly the believers that the enemy (Satan) will not employ his human agents to attack us either physically or spiritually. In fact, His Word reveals in Isaiah 54:15 that “…they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.” This means that as long as we are dwelling in God's secret place the enemy can do or scheme whatever they will, but it will not harm us. Rather, it is the enemy that will fall in the end.  |Psalm 91:4 reveals that as long as we are dwelling in the secret place of God He will cover us with His wings, we will be safe in His care and His faithfulness will protect and defend us. This means that having God as our shelter and refuge gives us strength and courage, and we should entertain no fear whatsoever. As children of God, if we are stuck deep in fear, then we might need to check our lives to ascertain that we have not fallen short of living in that secret place and trusting in God as our Protector and Comforter. Sometimes, the Almighty God may permit some unpalatable things to happen (e.g. the story of Job), but as His Word says in Isaiah 54:15, those unpalatable things, though permitted, are not by Him but part of the scheme of darkness; therefore we will always have victory, i.e. the victory that will always translate to the fall and failure of the enemies.  |A very apt example is our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God, but He had to die for the sake of man. However, the end result is even more glorious because: He resurrected, ascended to heaven, He is given name that is above all other names and He became the Head of all principalities and powers. At His name, Satan has to bow. And by His death and resurrection, He also gave power to anyone who would believe in Him and make Him the Lord of their lives and they too will have victory over every power of darkness.  |Brethren, in this new year, let us be resolute on the decision to dwell in God's secret place as we know that no power is out of God's control and no power can overcome us as long as we keep dwelling in His Secret Place. His Secret Place is His Word and the Word is Jesus. We will not be afraid of all and any kind of destruction that could come in all kinds of circumstances (at night or in the day - be it in darkness or noonday); be it pestilence or destruction of any kind. We will not be afraid no matter how the enemy tries to attack us. We will not be afraid because God is able to defend us as His children. Isaiah 54:17 also says that no weapon of the enemy formed or fashioned against us will be able to hurt us. Also, as long as we dwell in the secret place of the Most High, we will be able to operate with the power that Jesus Christ gives us as written in Luke 10:19 that: “…I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.”. Fear is banished from us as we dwell in God's Secret Place. |To understand this power better, let us picture someone who is on the wrong side of the Law; (in other words someone who commits a crime which is not known or nobody knows about it). Whenever such a person sees a police car, fear will grip his or her heart. But as long as such a person abandons the life of crime and lives right, there can be no fear anymore. In the same manner, before we were saved, we were in fear of so many things. But once we know Him and accept Him as the Lord of our lives, He becomes the complete assurance of victory no matter the threat or attack of the enemies. Dwelling  in the secret place of the Most High therefore gives us immunity to fear i.e. we are exempted from the danger of fear which drives out faith because in His Secret Place we are able to trust Him and pray to Him. In His Secret Place we possess power through our confessions. E.g. when we say: “The Lord is my Refuge…', it follows that no harm will be permitted to overcome us. Thereby we have ultimate victory over every attack of the enemy. Lastly, the fact that we are dwelling in God's secret place is not an antidote for troubles of the enemy but as Vs.3 says, there is assurance of deliverance. In fact, in the trouble, God promises to be with us as written in Vs.15b. This promise of God to be with us is also revealed by Prophet Isaiah Chapter 43 that “…Do not be afraid, I will save you. I have called you by name, you are mine...When you pass through deep waters, I will be with you; your troubles will not overwhelm you. When you pass through fire, you will not be burnt; the hard trials that come will not hurt you. For I am the LORD your God, the Holy God of Israel, who saves you…(Vs.1-3). Hallelujah! |Brethren, as we journey on in this new week and in the new year, knowing not what it has in stuck, but trusting God, and as we remain in God's Secret Place, “no power of hell or scheme of men” will ever pluck us from the protective hand of God in Jesus name. |"

      "message": "To dwell (i.e. live, reside or make it your permanent address) in the secret place of the Most High has immense benefits, and the Psalmist captures a few of them, and these few are worth more than priceless rubies. The first of these benefits is in Vs.3 that: “…He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence.” Here, the Psalmist employs metaphors to show the plots of the enemy which would entangle a man's affairs or compromise the man's loyalty to God.  What can amount to the snare of fowler (i.e. entanglement) are shown in the Psalmist prayer in Psalm 140:1-5 to include: (1) evil men, (2) violent men and the wicked men. These kind of agents of darkness are all around us - at home, place of work or market place. They do nothing but plan evil in their hearts, gather for war or sharpen their tongues against us like a serpent, and even plan to make our steps to stumble. And in Psalm 119:10, the Psalmist also prays for himself that God should not let him wander from God's commandments which results in failing in his loyalty to God. In his explanation of Psalm 91:3, Charles Spurgeon, the great preacher of  the 19th Century says: “We are foolish and weak as poor little birds, and are very apt to be lured to our destruction by cunning foes, but if we dwell near to God, He will see to it that the most skilful deceiver shall not entrap us.”  |A Fowler is a person who hunts wild fowl (bird). The Fowler therefore would set traps, entice or deceives the bird in different ways just to get it trapped and captured. In the same manner, the devil and his agents often work as the fowler works i.e., like the fowler the devil and his agents works in secret, changes his traps and methods, entice with pleasures or profits, or even use a decoy, just to trap one. May we not be trapped by the devil in Jesus name. |Brethren, these truths are for each of us individually if we will truly trust God and abide in Him. Prophet Jeremiah recognised that a man does not have what it takes to guide himself and so he confessed that: \"I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps\" (Jeremiah 10:23). Because we do not have what it takes to direct our protect ourselves as humans, the need to dwell in the Secret place of God and be under His Shadow for protection, guidance and guardian can never be over emphasised. |The second benefit found in Vs.3 is deliverance from deadly pestilence. God protects His children in times of plagues and diseases. We were all living witness to how God protected Africa from the carnage of human lives during COVID-19. The Psalmist, inspired by the Holy Spirit, did not intend this as an absolute promise, that every believer would be delivered from every snare or every pestilence. But, he could point to many times when God did just that for His people that will trust Him. This is why dwelling in the secret place of the God is a matter of trust level for God. This also does not mean that those who trust God have never died from infectious diseases or suffer from an enemy's plot, (some have). But He is simply telling us that those who trust God are habitually delivered from such dangers. We can say that despite the other odds in Africa, because the Africans trust God more than they would trust the system, Africa was delivered from the prediction of picking deaths from the streets of Africa during the pestilence of COVID. God is always on the side of those who trust Him - not for their sakes but for His name's sake. This is His promise in Isaiah 48:11 that: “For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.”.  |So, brethren, the first benefit of dwelling in the secret place of God is that no matter how the enemy schemes or plans evil against us either physically or spiritually, we can be sure that God will deliver us in a mysterious and miraculous way. Today, I pray that we and all our loved ones will have the grace to continually dwell in the secret place of the Most High God in Jesus name. |"

      "message": "A secret place often connotes a hiding-place. It is like the places that king David resorted to when he was a fugitive, running away from king Saul. The secret place of God also can mean the Most Holy Place in the Tabernacle or Temple. It is also the sacred chamber, the abode of the Shekinah Glory of God's presence. The secret place of the Most High therefore refers to the place of God's presence. God has a secret hiding place, and He wants each of us (as His children), to be there with Him. God is not inviting us to visit His secret place, but to dwell there; meaning to live there. So that God's secret place becomes our own addresses.  |From the text of today in Psalm 91, God invites us to pack up and move to His secret place. And to do so means to walk away from the clamour and enticements of the world. It means to be willing to quiet our hearts before God and allow Him to investigate those inner recesses we reveal to no one else. Secret place of the Most High God also implies a place of honesty and trust. We cannot join God in His secret place unless we are willing to be transparent and honest with Him. And so, when we dwell in God's secret place, the Psalmist says we shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. In other words, our protection is sure. |Shadow generally refers to Protection from the Sun. It also means to be under the power of God. In other words, no harm can come to the person who has come to the secret place of the Almighty God. And, for us to attain this, our focus has to be totally on God. Hence the scriptures says in Colossians 3:1-3 that “Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.” Going by this scripture, a man that will dwell in the secret place will be one that will possess the following character: (a) Love to be alone with God, (b) Worship within the veil, and (c) Converse with God in solitude.  |When we are able to do these, the result is what the Psalmist captures from Vs. 2-16. Verse 2 says: “I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, My God, in whom I trust [with great confidence, and on whom I rely]!”(AMP). This is a confession and affirmation of the Psalmist's faith in God for his protection.  |In this new year and as a believer, our confession must be a confirmation of our faith in God for the year because every new year is like going through a maze. Everyone is moving on without anyone knowing where the next turn is leading to or what the next turn will unfold. But when we trust God and our trust is affirmed by our confessions, the Bible says we will have what we say. (Numbers 14:28). So, the secret place of the Most High is the only place that we can be to have the confidence that no matter what the year holds, it is only the good in it that will be our portion.  |The Book of Genesis makes us to know that God created the world and man that dwells in it. (Genesis 1). Satan did not create anything. But when he fell from being an Angel to becoming devil, God did not take his power from him, because the gift of God is without repentance (Romans 11:29). Therefore, although satan does not have power to create, he however has enough power to destroy. Hence Jesus Christ reveals in John 10:10a that satan has come to steal and kill and destroy. But as long as we dwell in the secret place of God, satan's power and all his evil plan and agenda for the new year can never succeed against us as children of God. |Therefore, following the general statement of the Psalm 91:1-2,  the psalmist goes on in the successive verses to describe the specific ways that God will protect and care for us as His children as we progress through the year, beginning with the rescue from those who would try to trap us as the fowler snares birds.  |I pray that in the year 2023, as our permanent address remains the Secret Place of the Most High, under God's Shadow. Therefore, however much satan may try with all its ills, we will only see it with our eyes, but it will never have any effect on us. (Psalm 91:7-8). Brethren, for the next couple of weeks, we will be looking at all the benefits of dwelling in God's secret place, starting with protection from the fowler. I pray that we and all our loved ones shall remain in the secret place of the Most High God and remain covered by His shadow. |"

      "message": "Our text today says that God always leads us to triumph in Christ, and this makes us to spread the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. God is the All sufficient God, and in every challenge, He will always give victory so that when we testify or when others see our victory, they will ask how we came into such victory and we can say: “It is God”, and so others turn to Him. This is how His knowledge is spread. But sometimes, when we are in very dare needs of material things, either for ourselves or for our loved ones, and it looks like it is a tough order to get the needs met, the enemy then starts to minister negativity to our minds. Particularly in the kind of setting that Africans are, with a system of government that cares less about the welfare of the people. At such times, our backs are against the wall, and as humans, we begin to question if God truly takes care of all our material needs? Brethren the answer is always Yes, God will. |The story of the children of Israel in the wilderness as recorded in Exodus chapters 16 and 17 is a typical example of God's provision in time of dare needs. When they wandered in the wilderness, they needed shoes, clothes, food and water for forty years. There was no GAP, Marks & Spencer around nor was there income nor income support for them. There were no politicians to flex muscle of “I can give you if you will....” But God was always with them. He took care of their material needs and He surely can take care of yours today too.  |Another example is Elijah in 1 Kings 19:4-7, we read how God sent an angel to feed Elijah after the battle with the false prophets. Elijah was very hungry but the Almighty God was sufficient to provide him with material needs. The 2nd example with the same Elijah is in 1 Kings 17:2-7 when Elijah was feed by ravens. This again shows that God can take care of the material needs of His children. The Almighty God also took care of the widow in 1 Kings 17:8-16, God used the widow to feed the man of God. And by the woman's obedience despite her meagre resources, God gave her plenty for her household. The Bible says that her “...jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the Lord that He spoke by Elijah” (1 Kings 17:16). Glory to the all sufficient God! Also, in 2 Kings 4:1-9, is the story of how the wife of a prophet that died but was in debt and the debtors were coming to take the widow's only son away. The All Sufficient God increased the widow's oil and food because she also obeyed God's leading through the prophet Elisha. |In the New Testament, we also read of how Jesus fed the multitudes as recorded in Matthew 14:15-21. The multitudes of people was hungry after they had followed Jesus throughout the day. This reminds me of recent that a foundation had school fees of some less-privileged children to pay. The testifier said they didn't want to go begging for money because of the situation of the economy. Everyone was actually complaining. At such times they called on God. The All sufficient God touched the heart of a woman who sent money to the account of the foundation (without anyone asking). The All sufficient God moves the woman to pay enough money to cover the fees of the three children. All sufficient God provided for the work of the Foundation.  |Brethren that is reading this, God's promise to you today is as stated in Matthew 6:25 that: \"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\" Whatever is your present need, the All sufficient God is more than able and more than enough for you. As our main text today says: We only need to trust Him. Just as God did in the past for men of old and even in this time, He will surely come forth for you because the knowledge of God must be spread through that which God has done for you. Merry Christmas and happy new year in advance. |"

      "message": "Still on the theme of trusting God, for us as children of God, to trust God is not just a feeling, it is more than that. Trusting God is a choice, it is a choice to have faith in what God says even when your feelings or the circumstances around you is telling you something different. |Although our feelings may be real and in fact they are. They are what we must pray about, so that they don't lead us astray or into unbelief. This is because the Almighty God cares about our feelings and our circumstances. But this does not make them alone to be reliable enough for us to base our lives on them. Circumstances can change and same for feelings, and they can change any moment. But God cannot not change. God is the same yesterday, today and forevermore. Therefore He alone is worthy of our trust. |But, trusting God does not mean ignoring our feelings or the reality of our situation. Trusting God does not mean pretending that everything is okay when it is not in anyway okay. An example is Rahab (Joshua 2:1-7). Her situation was not okay as a harlot. But she trusted the God of the Jews and she hid the spies from the king. Trusting God therefore means, to live a life of belief in and obedience to God even when it is difficult. |The question now is having known what it means to trust God, how can we do that in our day to day lives? If we trust someone, we find ourselves being comfortable with being honest with them about anything. But the Almighty God is much more reliable than even our most trustworthy friend. When things become difficult, God does not ask us to keep our feelings to ourselves. This is why the Bible tells us that: “...we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin” (Hebrews 4:15). Because God loves us, we can always go to Him and talk to Him about our feelings, our circumstances and situations. When we talk to God about those things, we are showing God that we trust Him and we can talk to Him about the good and the bad and even the ugly. We do this through prayer. Jesus also poured His heart to God about the difficulty of what He has to go through (Mark 14:35-36). |As children of God, we need not let our emotions rule our lives, but rather we must bring those emotions to God so that God can help us to address them. God is not disappointed or frustrated by anyone's struggles, doubts or pain. Rather, God cares about us all, and we can trust Him with everything. When we trust God, we go to Him and His word when life and situations are hard. We also act in obedience to His Word, doing that which He says in His Word and trust that He will ultimately take care of everything. When we trust Him we do not set our minds on our being secure in any other thing but Him. We look look to Him and hold on securely to Him in difficult circumstances.  |Although we cannot do this perfectly on our own, but God in His kindness is patient with us as we learn to trust Him. Today, whatever may be the difficult situation, go to Him in prayer and rest your mind on Him. (Isaiah 26:3). He will come forth for you and give you rest. |"

      "message": "The text of today is the assurance that God is sufficient in troubled times as stated by Moses to the children of Israel when they were being pursued by Pharaoh with 600 of Egypt's best chariots, along with the rest of the chariots of Egypt(Vs.7). To put this in perspective, let us remind ourselves that the Jews were not soldiers. They had never fought any war before their encounter in the wilderness after leaving the place of slavery in Egypt. The Bibles says that as Pharaoh approached, they (Israelites) panicked when they saw the Egyptians overtaking them. They knew there was no way they could overcome a whole army of Pharaoh. Pharaoh was a world power of that time. They were so perplexed that they actually said it was better for them to remain as slaves in Egypt than to be wasted in the wilderness.  |At this point, Moses that knew the ways of God, and knowing that God is a man of war who never abandoned His own had to give them the word of assurance. The end of the story is well known in history. (Verses 24-31 gives a full account of Israel's victory and the destruction of Pharaoh and all his best chariots. God gave them victory by first throwing the the forces of Pharaoh into total confusion(vs.24). By the same token, no matter what the enemy has put together against you, the Almighty God is going to put your enemy into total confusion and you will have the victory in Jesus name. Our God is all sufficient when we are in dangerous situations. He that wonderfully protected His children (Israel) and destroyed those who were set against them will give you victory.  |The story of Rahab the harlot is another example of God's protection as recorded in Joshua chapter 6. Again in Joshua 10:1-14, God made the sun to stand still for Joshua and his army of men so that they could win the battle. Let us think of it again; “The sun was made to stop”, just for Joshua and his army. Brethren, He is still God and can do more than that for anyone that will trust Him. Gideon also trusted God for the victory over the Midianites in Judges chapter 7. The three Hebrew boys were cast into a fiery furnace because they refused to worship an idol. But the All sufficient God kept them from harm while in the fire. And the Bible says He even visited these men in that fire, as we read that the king stated, \"I see four men walking in the fire, and the fourth is like the Son of God.\" Daniel was also another example of the sufficiency of God in time of trouble in Daniel chapter 6.  |In the New Testament, Paul and Silas were put in jail ready to be killed. The Bible says in Acts 16:26 that: “suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened.” God is sufficient in time of trouble, let us trust Him."

When we say all sufficient God, it simply means  that no matter what happens to God's children, God can take care of if we can just trust Him. This may sound to some people like we are just raising one's hopes. But, brethren, it is the truth. God can see us through every time of trouble and trial and bring us out victoriously. God can also send every comfort when it is needed. God can take care of every financial need. God can truly be our “All Sufficient God.” Brethren, God can and He will take care of your every need.  |The Almighty God has for thousands of years taken care of His children and their needs. There are uncountable number of people who have testified and are still testifying to the great things that God has done and is doing for them. The Holy Bible is replete with the account of men and women to show us the wonders of God's all sufficiency. And Adam and Eve are the first of such examples. Adam and Eve fell into trouble with God. The enemy's intention was to rob them of their relationship with God, bring shame upon them and eventually kill them. God saw them through every stage of their trial and gave them victory over the devil. In the time of trials, temptation and trouble, however terrible the situation is, no matter the depth to which a man falls, if only he can turn to God in repentance, ask for mercy and take on a Christlike life, he will not only have victory, but become a tool in God's hand to save others. Genesis chapter 3 is the story of the fall of man and woman. After their fall, God shed the blood of an innocent animal just to clothe the nakedness of Adam and Eve with coats of skins and cover their shame (Genesis 3:21). |In the Book of Acts, we read the story of a man called Saul. He had been a persecutor of Christians. In Acts 9, to further his threats and murder against the disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ he had asked for letter from the high priest to take to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who believes in Jesus Christ and resurrection, he might arrest them and bring them to Jerusalem to be tried (Acts 9:1-2). But as he travelled on, he was struck by a blinding light and there he met the Saviour Jesus Christ. Saul's name was changed to Paul, and he said in His letter to Timothy that:  \"He was the chief of sinners” (1 Timothy 1:15). In God's sufficiency, He saved Saul who used to be \"a blasphemer, a persecutor and injurious person, but he obtained the mercy of God.  |Brethren, is there a loved one of yours that is towing the path of destruction? Don't stop praying for them. If you do not give up on them, God in His all Sufficiency will save them. They will be like Paul in God's hand. Whatever may be your need - material, physical or financial, trust in the all sufficient God and you will testify in Jesus name. |"

Like the mirror would reflect the person looking into the mirror, the Bible tells us that we should reflect the character and likeness of Jesus Christ. We should have the same attitude of Jesus. That may sound like a pretty tall order; after all, Jesus is the Son of God. But when we accept Him as our Lord and Savior, we become sons and daughters of the Most High God as well by adoption through the blood of Jesus. We become empowered by the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead. This means that He puts on us His own Spirit. Making us to do things the way He would do it. This is why the true believing child of God, Spirit filled does not find it difficult to forgive; even when others would feel it is folly not to retaliate.  |The Spirit that is in Christ is the spirit of humility, of strength, of love, and of power. He alone can equip us as human beings to follow His example and do what He would do. Jesus while on earth went about doing good” (Acts 10:38). And the good He was doing brought healing to others - physically, material, spiritually and emotionally. The text of today says: “Have this attitude…” How do we have it? By allowing God to work in our attitudes and actions. We must allow the word of God to be the motivation for what you do or say or how we react to situations.  |There is no doubt that people can be somewhat annoying in their attitude and no one can really control the attitude of another person, but you can control your own reaction. If you say you will only forgive your own brother or sister, but would pay others in their own coin, Jesus says the unbelievers would do the same thing as such, no difference between you and the unbelievers. (Matthew 5:43-47). Jesus concludes by saying “You must be perfect just as your Father in heaven is perfect!” (Matthew 5:48).  |Therefore, decide to open every area of your life to Jesus. Is there anyone who has offended you and you have vowed not to forgive? Determine today to reflect Christ through forgiveness. Cast all the offence down before the feet of Jesus, and don't allow anything that exalts itself against God in your life, and pull it down (2 Corinthians 10:5). Apostle Paul reechoed and said, “Do everything possible on your part to live in peace with everybody.” (Romans 12:18). By so doing, you will mirror Jesus.

      "message": "Our text today was written by the Psalmist, King David. This was a man after the heart of God, yet he had aggressive enemies. Some versions referred to this as “vigorous enemies.” Have you ever felt the same way as David? Have people spoken against you for no reason, betrayed you, tried to keep you from success or tried to prevent you from getting good things or even your entitlement for no just cause? These are the enemies that each of us has to deal with in this life. And, the truth is that they will try you in every possible way. |The natural response to the enemies is usually to fight back, get even, and put them in their place, or even demand justice. Often times, their actions also get one distressed as we try to figure out why they are against us in the first place. And before you know it, the situation begins to consume all your thoughts and bringing you torments. However, the Almighty God expects us to respond to our enemies with love, prayer, forgiveness and blessing. The fact is that, although the enemy is a human being but he\/she is already in Satan's line of fire and he\/she is being controlled by Satan to do havoc. Therefore, as children of God, we must not get ourselves in the same line through our actions or reactions. We must make room for God to handle the justice of the situation by Himself as only He alone can. What we must not do is worry. God has promised to handle them on our behalf. This is the essence of the Psalmist prayer in Psalm 35:1 that: “Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!” When God fights against the enemy the following five (5) things will eventually happen: |First; God will bring everything hidden thing into the light. An enemy can be very sneaky. They will say cutting remarks to you that no one else notices, threaten you when others aren't around, or try to quietly cheat you out of money, opportunities or relationships. Even so, there is One who sees everything that is done in secret, and He says, “Nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light” (Luke 8:17, NKJV). Concerning that enemy, we only need to obey God and pray (Luke 6:27-36, Luke 8:17) and thank God, He will bring an end to their evil. |Secondly, God will avenge for you. The desire you have for justice can only come from God in whose image we are created. He is the God of justice, and He loves justice. In Romans 12:19 His Word says: 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay...” (ESV). He did for Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego (Daniel chapters 3 and 6) |Thirdly, God will deal with our enemy according to His Word of Blessing in Deuteronomy 28:7 which says: “The Lord shall cause your enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before your face. God also promised that: “They will come against you one way but flee before you seven ways.” All we need to do is to work in obedience so that we can remain under God's blessings which gives us automatic victory, however long it may take. He will not let the enemy succeed against you. Our greatest enemy has come to steal, kill and destroy. But he does not work alone. He will use other people (even so called Christians) to carry out his plans. Sometimes, it may look as if the plans of the enemy are succeeding. But God's promise is sure. He says in Isaiah 54:17 that: “No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment you shall condemn”. Again, we only need to walk in love toward them, and stand on the Word of God in faith which has no fear. What He did for the children of Israel at the Red Sea (Exodus 15:4), He will do for you. |Fourthly; God will prepare a table before us. As we keep walking in love and in obedience to God's Word, no matter who comes against us, they cannot stop the blessings that God has in store for us. Satan will always use other people to try and get the child of God into stride knowing that if he can do that, then he will walk us out of the position to receive the blessings of God. We must therefore stay on the love line and never budge. No matter how much wrong they do to us. We must decide to forgive; as we continue to declare God's promise to prepare a table before us in the presence of our enemies (Psalm 23:5). Haman planned death of Mordecai but when God took over the battle. Yhe Bible says that: “...Haman took the robes and the horse, and he dressed Mordecai and led him through the square of the city, proclaiming before him, \"Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor\" (Esther 6:11). |Fifthly; the real enemy is Satan. And God is always there to help us to defeat him. This is why the Bible says in Ephesians 6:12-13, that we do not fight against flesh-and-blood, but against evil spirits. I believe most of us as believers know this truth, but it will take a constant reminder through the Word because we can see life and direct, flesh and blood causing so much trouble for us. But God has given you all authority over the enemy. So, when the enemy tries to send people our way, we must rebuke Satan and send him packing, and back to where he belongs i.e. under our feet through the precious blood of Jesus. |Brethren, many of us are facing unjust and unimaginable attack from the enemy. And it is as though God is on vacation. No! He is not. He only needs us to stop worrying, He needs us not to try to get justice by ourselves, we must stop gossiping about the situation so shall our deal with Christ remains intact. Therefore, like the Psalmist says: your aggressive enemy may hate you without reason, yours is to stay in obedience, and let God deal with the enemy. And He surely will and you will have the victory."

      "message": "Still on the defeat of the enemy, our text today reveals that Heaven defeated satan and threw him down to the earth. In other words, Satan's attack started in heaven. But the heavenly hosts defeated him. Having been thrown down to earth, with his power and the fallen agents that joined in his rebellion against God, the attack continued on earth against humans. The aim of the enemy is simply as Jesus Christ reveals in John 10:10 - to kill, steal and destroy.  |When satan was thrown down, the Almighty God did not disposes him of his powers. But thanks to Jesus who went down to the hades to seize power from the enemy of man's soul (Acts 2:31-32). Therefore, any man that accepts Jesus as his Lord and Saviour can overcome the enemy.  |Man must however not live their lives any how, even after accepting Christ. Man must be deliberate to live thoughtfully and Godly. Because as long as man is on earth, every day is a day of war between man and the enemy, and he will employ other human agents. Hence, the Bible warns that the believer must ”Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NLT). We must never make light of Satan's intentions. In the Book, “The Art of War” the author, Sun Tzu, says, “He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.” We shall not be captured in Jesus name. Amen.  |But, in order not to be captured, every believer must exercise “Forethought” by thinking and planning ahead of the enemy's attacks. The believer must not be shocked or show dismay when the enemy starts to use his strategies to try and steal, kill and destroy. We must take our roles seriously and not take the strategies of the enemy lightly. God does not intend that the enemy should outsmart any of His children. Hence, the Psalmist reveals the mind of God in Psalm 89:22 that: “The enemy shall not outwit him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.” This promise will be fulfilled in our lives in Jesus name. However, we must be deliberate to live by His Word so that we do not make ourselves vulnerable to the enemy. Therefore we must get familiar with the evil schemes of the enemy according to the Word of God in 2 Corinthians 2:11. This is what the Military refers to as intelligence. Psalm 144:1 says that God trains our hands for war. And the enemy's strategies are also revealed to us through the Word of God and also tells us the plan of counterattack through our prayers.  |Brethren, the enemy wants to kill, steal and destroy man's destiny, progress, wealth and well-being, peace of mind, prosperity, good health and the entire destiny of man, not because he needs the use of it, but because he does not want man to manifest the glory of God. As such, he is prepared to waste it. But we can defeat him on our knees. So that he is not able to catch us off guard. Hence, the saying goes that: “Pray not be become a Prey”. We must be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. But only by His Word because His Word which is the sword of the Spirit. (Ephesians 6:10-18). You can defeat the enemy."

      "message": "Still on the defeat of the enemy, our text today reveals that Heaven defeated satan and threw him down to the earth. In other words, Satan's attack started in heaven. But the heavenly hosts defeated him. Having been thrown down to earth, with his power and the fallen agents that joined in his rebellion against God, the attack continued on earth against humans. The aim of the enemy is simply as Jesus Christ reveals in John 10:10 - to kill, steal and destroy.  |When satan was thrown down, the Almighty God did not disposes him of his powers. But thanks to Jesus who went down to the hades to seize power from the enemy of man's soul (Acts 2:31-32). Therefore, any man that accepts Jesus as his Lord and Saviour can overcome the enemy.  |Man must however not live their lives any how, even after accepting Christ. Man must be deliberate to live thoughtfully and Godly. Because as long as man is on earth, every day is a day of war between man and the enemy, and he will employ other human agents. Hence, the Bible warns that the believer must ”Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:8 NLT).

      "message": "The life of man is a life of battles. The battle line was first drawn immediately that God created man after Lucifer fell. Lucifer became satan and has since been after the soul of man to steal the souls of man from God so that man can worship him and not God. Therefore, the day a believer gives his\/her life to Christ, the battle begins. And he also employs fellow human beings whose hearts he has already stolen to attack the believer in diverse ways.  |The battles may be physical or spiritual, but one thing is certain; all battles are engineered by man's arch-enemy, Satan. Because satan is spirit, he needs human agents and so,  he does not attack without human agents. So, the human being that physically antagonises through their actions are mere agents used by Satan to perpetrate his actions against us. While he employs humans, he also employs different strategies for his evils with the intention of keeping us defeated. He can do this by a tracking our finances, career, family and loved ones. And so, there's need for us as children of God not to let the devil keep us defeated by not allowing him to catch us off our guards. As believers, we can defeat the enemy every time because the enemy has already been defeated by Christ at His resurrection. Therefore; through His resurrection, Jesus has disarmed the enemy. This is what the text of today tells us. But for us to manifestly defeat the enemy's various attacks, we must have a battle plan. This is because; although defeated at the cross, Satan still employs strategies against the believer because he (Satan) has the control of this world. The Bible says: Woe unto the earth for we send down satan...(Revelation 12:12). So, we need to have the right strategy for the battle.  |In the Military, it is said that no military unit would ever dream of going to war without a battle plan. In other words, no military unit will go to war without a strategy to exploit the enemies' weaknesses and maximise their own strengths so that they can win. As such, the day the believer makes his\/her commitment to giving his\/her life to Christ and work in obedience to the word of God, the battle line is drawn. Therefore, the need arises for the believer to have strategies to defeat the enemy because it is a spiritual enemy, Satan, that we have and has continued to wage war against us. |According to today's text, Jesus has already defeated Satan for us, but that doesn't mean Satan is not going to use certain strategies to try and trick us into believing otherwise. Satan's strategies are intended to keep us defeated and to take over everything that is rightfully ours. We have a duty to stop him. This is why the believer cannot sit, sleep or be docile on the battlefield of life. Jesus Christ warns that the enemy has come to kill, steal and destroy (John 10:10a). |We must not deceive ourselves by saying that, “The enemy is already defeated,” and therefore lie down and make ourselves comfortable but vulnerable. If as believers, we do not have any responsibility to stand our ground against the devil's schemes, God's Word would not have instructed us to: “resist the devil” (James 4:7). Nor would we have been told to use “the weapons of our warfare” (2 Corinthians 10:4). Also, Jesus would not have had any need to give us “authority to trample over all the power of the enemy” (Luke 10:19). All these show that there is a responsibility on our part to actualise the victory revealed in our text today. There are strategies for the believers and there are weapons to employ for the warfare, but none is an AK47. Jesus Christ made it clear in Matthew 26:52 that our weapon is not carnal when He said to His Disciples “Put away your sword...” ( NLT). Without the sword, Jesus defeated satan at His resurrection. As believers, we can defeat every human agent of satan as well.  |Therefore brethren, whatever may be the attack of the enemy, don't join issues with the enemy by going physical with the human agents through our actions against such human agents. Also, do not compromise your position in Christ by going to beg the enemy or cringe to the human agent. Rather, know your position in Christ and go on your knees before God. We can defeat the enemy on our knees; and by His Power, we will. You will be the victorious one in Jesus name."

      "message": "A few people say that they do not like surprises. However, we serve the God of surprises. As such, I pitch my tent with those who like surprises. And I pray for you that the Lord will pleasantly surprise you in Jesus name.  |Surprise is simply an unexpected or astonishing event, fact, etc. With this in mind, let us consider the Biblical record of Moses and the burning bush revealed in our text today. The unusual or unexpected in that story is that the bush was burning but it was not consumed. This certainly is a surprise beyond human understanding. Our God has always been the God of surprises. Examples abound in the word of God as to how God surprises His children.  |Because Moses' experience was an unusual thing, he said to himself in verse 3, “This is strange...Why isn't the bush burning up? I will go closer and see.” And just as Moses did as he said; behold, there is another surprise in verse 4, as Moses heard a voice from the midst of the bush calling out his name. Moses was watching one thing with amazement, wondering how can this be, then, suddenly he heard his name called out from the midst of the unusual thing. That was certainly a great surprise.  |God also surprised Abraham and Sarah with the birth of Isaac at a time of their ages, particularly Sarah's age, when it was both medically and physically impossible to get pregnant. At the Red Sea; the children of Israel had concluded that God of Moses had abandoned them. There is no record that they could swim. They have been in slavery for over four hundred years. But the God of surprises showed Himself mighty as Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and God drove the sea back with a strong east wind and the children of Israel crossed on dry land. (See Exodus 14:21). |Also, in the New Testament, the seventy that Jesus sent out came back surprised that they could cast out evil spirits in the name of Jesus.(Luke 10). At the tomb of Lazarus; Mary had given up hope. It was a forgone conclusion. Lazarus had been dead for four days; but when Jesus appeared, everyone present, and even those that later heard were surprised at Lazarus woke up from the dead after four days. (See John chapter 11). |Brethren, whatever looks like an impossibility plaguing your life, and looking like there is no possible solution in sight; the Almighty is saying to you today, that He will surprise you. And for you, just as God said to the children of Israel at the Red Sea, as recorded in Exodus 14:18  that: “...the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I have gained my honour...” By the spoken word of God, the desire of your heart that men have said is no longer possible shall be made possible for you.  The Lord will have to gain His Honour in your life, and so God will pleasantly surprise you with your heart desires in Jesus name. The Lord will show up for you. He sure will, He will surprise you."

      "bibleRef": "“From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violent assault, and violent men seize it by force [as a precious prize]” (Matthew 11:12 AMP).",
      "message": "The above Scripture is direct by our Lord Jesus Christ and it is as such very sacred and unimpeachable. The kingdom of God requires violence (holy violence) to have as a precious prize because the devil that is already condemned will do all it can to prevent man from getting there. And so, the violent takes it by force.  |If the God's kingdom can only be taken by those who will be spiritually violent, I believe that the same principle would apply to the glorious destiny that each of us and our children carry. The Bible says: “Everyone who is called by My Name, Whom I have created for My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made”(Isaiah 43:7 AMP). We are called by God's name and created for His Glory i.e. meaning we have a relationship with God through the only one name He provided for man and by which we are called Christians. See Acts 4:11-12. Each of us has a glorious destiny. And just as the enemy fights against man's reigning with God in His kingdom after this age, the same enemy will also contend vehemently against the manifestation of the glory that each man carries.  |The enemy contends with man against the glory that man carries not because he (the enemy) needs it, but just so that God is not glorified in man's life. The enemy knows that if we win the battle, we will testify, and  God will be glorified hence the battle for a glorious destiny becomes a fierce one. This can be confirmed by what the people of old went through. A typical example of one that lost the battle of glory was Samson. His enemy rejoiced over him as the Bible reveals said: “...the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, \"Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand\" (Judges 16:23). May our enemies never rejoice over us and our children in Jesus name.  |Although Samson cried out to God; He received forgiveness and mercy; regained his strength, but he died with his enemies ( Judges 16:30). This is why the battle for destiny also requires holy violence. As we see in the life of Joseph who though suffered but overcame with violent holiness as he responded to the carrot of temptation in Genesis 39:9 with the fear of God, and desire to rather not sin against God. Daniel, Shedrach, Meshach and Abednego all chose not to bow to foreign god and would not defy themselves with choice meals of the king (Daniel 3:16-28). Each of them though suffered a bit, but attained their glorious destinies. See Daniel 2:48 and 3:30. Each of these men had to contend with the enemies of their glorious destiny. I pray that by the mercy of God, we and our children will win in Jesus name. Amen  |God has put His children on earth and called us from darkness into His marvellous light to showcase His Glory (1 Peter 2:9). Our lives on earth is supposed to be a replica of what it is in heaven. But when we fall for the temptation to sin like our forefathers, then the devil begins to lead man to substitute God's plan with his own plan. Jesus Christ did not leave us uninformed of the contention of the enemy against the glorious destiny of man. Jesus says in John 10:10 that: “The thief's purpose is to steal, kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life” (NLT).  |The Word of God says in Psalm 91:16 that He will satisfy us with long life and also Show is His salvation. But the truth is that the enemy is not going to fold its arms and be an onlooker for man to achieve this. He is prepared to fight tooth and nail. This is why as much as the kingdom of God suffers violence, the battle for our destinies also suffers the same violence. But we can take it by our violent holiness in obedience to the Word of God. And as we live in obedience to God's Word, He shows us, leads us and takes us step by step from one level to another level, just as the Bible reveals about the journey of Israel into the Promised Land in Exodus 23:28 that the Hittite will confront them but God sent hornets before the Israelites to drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites. God will do same for us in the journey to attain our destinies too but we must be willing to please God all the way.  |Brethren, the kingdom of God suffers violence and the violent takes it by force. Same goes for the battle for our glorious destiny. We shall take it by holy violence. We must not look at how the wicked is making it at all. Psalm 73:2:15 shows that David felt the same way. But the Psalmist also reveals that God sets them in slippery places; God makes them to fall to ruin.(Psalms 73:18). As we look to God, stand on His Word in violent obedience, we will contend with the giant against our glorious destinies and win in Jesus name."

      "message": "In Exodus 33:1-12, there was a conversation between God and Moses, wherein God instructed Moses to take the Israelites to the land of promise. In verse 12, Moses said to the Lord that He has not told him whom He (God) will send to go with him (Moses). And God responded with our text today; promising that His presence with go with Moses. |Moses did not want to take one step without the fullness of the presence of God. Can this be true of us in our daily life? In Exodus 33:14, God said to Moses: “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” Moses surely knew the best thing to ask for. No man can successfully tread the journey of this life without God. Prophet Jeremiah realised this when he confessed that:  |“I know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself, that it is not in man who walks to direct his steps” (Jeremiah 10:23). |What do we understand by the presence of God? The most common Hebrew term for \"presence\" is \"panim\" which means \"face\", and this implies a close and personal encounter with the Lord. So, when we have the presence of God, His face is actually upon us. In the Book of Numbers, God specifically told Moses to “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the people of Israel. And the first blessing is: “the LORD make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you” (Numbers 6:25). God's presence is His face shinning upon us. When the face of God is shining on us as His children, any power of darkness that tries to do any harm to us will be like a thief or robber that attempts to sneak into a house surrounded by forge lights and CCTV Cameras. The thief will just quietly walk into his own doom. When Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were being taken away to be dropped into the fiery burning furnace; it was those that cast them in the fire that got burned. Same for Daniel, those that threw him in the lions' den eventually were the meat for the lions while Daniel had a nice time relaxing with lions. (See Daniel chapters 3 and 6). |Moses surely got the best deal in life when God said “My Presence will go with you”. The Psalmist says of the Lord: “You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy...” (Psalm 16:11a). Fullness of joy is being complete in every way in God's presence, so that even if there's a challenge, we have the assurance that by reason of the presence of God, victory is the ultimate result. Also, the presence of God brings protection, security, favour and blessings.  |Brethren, I want to encourage us to pray always that: “God, I don't want to do anything alone today, I don't want to do anything alone, I want to be in your presence all day long.” We must not live our lives without the presence of God manifested through His Holy Spirit. At Jesus ascension after the resurrection, He made a promise in Matthew 28:20 thus: “...behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\" As much as this promise is for us, we also must ensure that we do not leave His presence through sinful life. Let us remember that God's eyes cannot behold sin (Habakkuk 1:13). |The Presence of the Lord is His Holy Spirit in us. Therefore, we must never do anything that will grieve Him, as doing so means departing from His presence. Anyone that departs from God's presence makes himself\/herself vulnerable to the powers of darkness. God has promised that “His presence will go with us\", may we remain in His presence always in Jesus name. Amen."

      "message": "The advice of the Preacher in our text today is not only unique but a very important one. Relating the scripture to the life of the children of God, saved by the blood of Jesus; the question is, after our salvation, what have we put our hands to do? The fact is that God does not save man just for man to sit down, enjoy his\/her salvation with no concern for those yet to be saved. He saves man so that man can worship and work in His vineyard while still on earth.  |We all know that there is nothing like non-functioning member of our human body except that part of the body is dead from accident or infirmity. There also ought not to be such thing as a non-functioning member of the Body of Christ, the Church. God saved us from our sin, and also calls us to serve Him in some ways in accordance with the gifts He deposited in everyone. God saved us from the awful judgment we deserved for our sins. We were bought with a price - the precious blood of Jesus. We belong to Him and He is expecting us to put our hands to work for Him. When we get saved, we got conscripted not just volunteers for Jesus, but we are expected to find something for our hands to do as members of the Body of Christ. Having been saved, we have been drafted into Jesus' army. Soldiers are always up and doing and very faithful to their calling. This is what is expected of us as believers. |As this year is gradually running out, we need to begin to take stock of what we have put our hands to do for God. There are different ways to serve God, and this is where each of us can determine what our hands find to do. Be it in going out to preach the word; using our money for the gospel or helping the less privileged. The Bible says: “Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord” (1 Corinthians 12:4-5). There is less than 5 months to the end of this year, each believer need to ask, “what have I done for the Lord?” “How has my gift been profitable to my Lord?” There are so many souls around us that we need to touch so that when the time to render returns comes, there is something to return for the Lord. Let us remember that the aim of our gifts and our service are to be utilised to bring forth children in the faith i.e. through the gospel. And if this is worthy to do, then it's worthy for us to do it with all of our might.  |Ephesians 5:16 says that we are to make “the best use of the time, because the days are evil.” Let us not waste any opportunity we have to speak of Jesus to others. It is the last charge which Jesus gave us in Matthew 28:19-20; and we need to work hard in His service. Are you therefore working hard or are you hardly working. Today, I charge each of us to begin to take stock as we begin to count down the year 2022. Let us not be Christians that are rusting out instead of wearing out in serving the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, if you have not been working, you can determine today to serve God with all of your might. God rewards everyone no matter when we start (Matthew 20:1-16). Jesus also says: “But Jesus answered them, \"My Father is working until now, and I am working\" (John 5:17). Let us put our hands to work."

      "message": "Our text of today says: “On Zion, God's sacred hill, there will be nothing harmful or evil...” The word Zion is used for the first time in 2 Samuel 5:7 and it became synonymous with the city of David. This place became significant immediately David brought the ark of the covenant into this Zion (2 Samuel 6:12). The ark of the covenant was the sacred seat of the Holy of Holies where God used to meet His people in the tabernacle. Therefore, Zion became the centre of worship and of the presence of God.  |When king Solomon moved the ark of the covenant into the temple that he had built the whole of Jerusalem was known as Zion (1 Kings 8:1). Therefore, in the Old Testament, when Zion is mentioned, it is referred to as the city of Jerusalem, the city of God's presence and the city of great hope for the people of God. The place where God was present and near to His people. The place from which the people expected help. The source of deliverance and salvation. Hence, Psalm 20:2 says: “May He send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.” Therefore, in the text of today, Prophet Isaiah revealed what the Lord says of Zion that “...there will be nothing harmful or evil...”.  Zion is the place of God's presence, the place of God's power and blessing and protection, the hope of God's future rule over the earth. What a great future for those who have come to Christ. This is why Apostle Paul could write to the Galatian Christians that: “...the heavenly Jerusalem is free, and she is our mother.” (Galatians 4:26). Zion is such a rich and hope-filled word for the true believing Christians.  |Applying these to the believers' lives, we are God's Zion because He dwells in us and there must be no evil to us. In other words, when we are subject to affliction,  deprivation, wrong, and deliberate unjust treatment; such to our God is an abomination because we are the Zion where He dwells. Even when God appears to be silent, He sees all because of mercy, He wants repentance for everyone. But just as the earth's suffering is a temporary one as there is hope of His Heavenly Zion free of every evil; the wrong against us is also a temporary one. And because we are His Zion, God will come forth for us and He will surely punish every unjust treatment meted to us as He says in His Word about every wicked ruler or boss that:  “You are doomed! You make unjust laws that oppress my people. That is how you prevent the poor from having their rights and from getting justice... What will you do when God punishes you? ..Where will you run to find help? Where will you hide your wealth?...the LORD 's anger will not be ended; his hand will still be stretched out to punish” (Isaiah 10:1-4). |However, God is more concerned that we make it to the Heavenly Zion, and so, we must never drift to the ways of those that are already doomed for destruction (unless they come to Christ). Therefore, we must keep holding unto faith, no matter the apparent injustice or wrongdoings against us. We are a citizen of Heaven; and just as help will always come to an ambassador in a foreign country; God will surely send help to us from the Zion above. And as today's text says that “there will be nothing harmful or evil”; God will certain not allow the unjust treatment and wrongs against us to become an evil. Whatever you are going through, be comforted with God's Word. It is temporary and Zion of God (you) will have the lasting joy over your enemy and the wicked ruler or boss."

      "bibleRef": "“On the third day Abraham saw the place in the distance. Then he said to the servants, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you” (Genesis 22:4-5 GNB).",
      "message": "When Abraham said to his servants “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there and worship and then we will come back to you”; it was a proof that as sure as day will follow night, that he was bringing Isaac back alive. Let us call to mind the fact that in Genesis 22:1-2, God called Abraham and said to him in clear terms that: he called to him: “....Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love so much, and go to the land of Moriah. There on a mountain that I will show you, offer him as a sacrifice to me.” Abraham certainly understands what it means to sacrifice someone. He certainly knows that for any living thing or being to be offered as sacrifice, they have to be killed. Yet he said,  “I will go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you.” As much as God spoke in clear terms to Abraham, he also spoke in clear terms to his servants. But the two statements do not mean the same. God said go and sacrifice your son. He said to his men, I and the son are going to worship and come back. What a faith.   |Abraham could only have said this because He knew and trusted the Character and goodness of God. Therefore, Abraham had no fear. Abraham knew that when God said go and sacrifice, He meant worship Me. Whatever we give to God is a form of worship. Simply put, we are called to worship the God with our wealth. And this has two essential aspects: it means obeying God's command (Exodus 19:5) and being wise and discerning stewards in how we use what God gives to us (Matthew 6:19-24). |So, four things made Abraham's faith not to be choked, and these are: He knew the nature of God, He trusted the nature and goodness of God, He was obedient, and He was a wise and discerning steward.  |Abraham knew that in the nature of God He does not take back what He gives (Romans 11:29). Secondly, Abraham knew that God is good and trusted in the fact that there is no shadow of turning with God (James 1:17).  |Abraham had always been obedient to God, so it was not difficult for Him to obey God because He remembers what God first told him when God called him out of his father's house.  |(Genesis 12:1-2). He knew that God was good to him by calling him out of his clan for his blessing and so, he was confident that God can never change from being good to him as there is no evil with God. Lastly, Abraham showed wisdom and discerning spirit. If he told his men exactly what God told him, they could discourage him or even snatch Isaac from him and run with Isaac back to Sarah. |Brethren, the opposite of all the above four points noted about Abraham are what can choke a believer's faith. How do you see yourself? Do you know God enough to trust in His character and goodness? Are we walking in obedience, even in little things? Jesus said in John 14:15 that if we love Him we will obey His commandments. Obedience is all about our love for God. Lastly are we wise and discerning enough not to go telling people or asking for their opinion about God's instructions? |Brethren, when we do these four things that Abraham did, then we have faith that is not choked."

      "message": "King David was a vivid example that God can show mercy, favour and protection against all odds; including one's mistake or sin. In other words, no matter what we have done in the past or even regrettable mistakes; once we turn to God and turn away from our sinful ways, God will have mercy, show favour and protect us from the enemy's exerting power. Looking at Psalm 89, we see the promises of God to bless and protect in this regard. As Believers, what God desires of us is to totally turn away from all our sinful ways in order for us to appropriate the fullness of His blessings and protection.  |There were two kings in Israel in quick succession i.e. King Saul and King David. There is no doubt that both of them sinned during the time of their reign. However, the difference between king David and King Saul was that one was humble enough to acknowledge his sin and repent of it; the other would rather make excuses and pass the blame. In First Samuel 28:1-25, Saul sees the huge Philistines army and because he knew that they could not match the strength of the Philistines he went to God and asked for help. But, God did not answer because he had disobeyed God in his failure to destroy  the Amalekites. So when God did not answer him, rather than repent of the sin that was blocking answers to his prayer, he went to the Witch of Endor, disguising himself because he knew that it was the law that no one should work with familiar spirits.   |The question is: “Who do we want to turn to in our time of trouble when it appears to us that God is not answering us? Brethren, at such times, we must look inwards and be resolute to stand with God no matter how long He takes to answer us because God will surely keep His promise to answer us (Habakkuk 2:3). Joshua also says that: “Not one word of all the good promises that the Lord had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass” (Joshua 21:45).  |So, in our main text today, we see that God blessed David with all the blessings in Psalm 89 because David would acknowledge his sin, repent, turn to God and stayed with God. The Psalmist then recounts the promises of God to him in Psalm 89 and particularly Vs. 22-29 that: God gave David the blessing of protection (the enemy shall not outwit him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him - Vs.22). The blessing of vindication (I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague those who hate him Vs.23). |The blessing of ongoing faithfulness and mercy (My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him Vs.24). The blessing of exalted strength (in My name his horn shall be exalted Vs.24). |Today, as the world around us is full of all manners of evils, as we stand on the side of God no matter the fierceness of the storm or powers of darkness, God's promise that “the enemy shall not outwit us and the the son of wickedness shall not afflict us and that He will strike down those who hate us shall all be fulfilled in our lives in Jesus name."

      "bibleRef": "“They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed” (Psalm 34:5 KJV).",
      "message": "Still on the subject of Looking to God, the Psalmist revealed that there is another effect of looking upon the Lord; and this is that “their faces were not ashamed”. King David knew that God would never forsake anyone that trusts in Him so that no shame will come to them. This is more so that His own name will not be profaned (Isaiah 48:11 and Ezekiel 20:9). How God does this is to give to those who trust Him the grace to have confidence in Him during their challenges; so that they can be saved in the end.  |Part of the Psalmist's looking up is that he cried unto the Lord. This he said in Psalm 34:6 that “This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.” Here, David emphasised his personal experience of these truths. He was the poor man that cried out to God in his distress and God graciously answered.  |The cry of God's children is often a short one, but not sweet at all.  It can be brief, but bitter. It is the language of pain. It is the cry that is natural and with much meaning but no music. God will instantly hear such cries of His children as can be seen Psalm 10:18 and Psalm 34:17. Also, in 2 Samuel 21:13, David acting as the madman among the Philistines was the poor man. In Psalm 18:6, David declared that, in his distress he called upon God and cried for help and that God heard his voice and his cry reached God's ears. When a child of God cries to God, it is very precious to God. God sees such a cry as a confession or acknowledgement of His children that they solidly trust in God alone for their help and God will answer speedily. This is in fact the import of God's Word through the Prophet in Isaiah 49:15.  |One thing that I have realised is that no father ever wants his children to cry. So, if earthly father can be that touched when his child cries, how much more our Heavenly Father. This is revealed in the account of the cry of Ishmael (the child of the bond woman) and how God instantly made a promise to make his descendants great as seen in Genesis 21:17-18:  “God heard the boy crying, and from heaven the angel of God spoke to Hagar, “What are you troubled about, Hagar? Don't be afraid. God has heard the boy crying. Get up, go and pick him up, and comfort him. I will make a great nation out of his descendants.” (GNBUK). So, God honours our cry whenever a challenge makes us to cry. Not to man, but to Him. God sees and feels our pain when we cry to Him as can be seen from the account of what happened when Jesus was on the cross as stated by Luke. God could not bare to look at the pain of His Son on the cross and He heard to turn His Face away. And when God did, the Bible says that: “...darkness came over the whole land...” (Luke 23:44).  |Unfortunately, people often cry to man first and when there's no help or solution, then they turn to God. Brethren, God wants us to cry to Him if we need to, and not to man. If we make Him our first port of call, He will always instantly answer and will set people or things in motion for our help.  |The next thing that “looking upon the Lord” means is that those who look up are seeking God, as shown in verse 4 where David confessed that he “sought the Lord”. Seeking the Lord is an attitude of the soul that is continuously directed towards God. It is an attitude of saying we look only to the great Friend and Helper; just as we should cry only to Him. And He will answer us as He answered David. Brethren, whatever may be the distress, trouble and\/or challenge; let us cry to our Father. Let us seek help from Him alone as we keep our focus on Him, the Great Friend and Helper. And as we do, He will send angels as helpers in human form speedily and save us from shame."

      "bibleRef": "“They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces were not ashamed” (Psalms 34:5 NKJV).",
      "message": "We are still looking at Psalm 34. The Psalmist says: “They looked to Him”. This means that the more we look (i.e., think) upon our Lord, and less upon ourselves and the situation, the better for us. When we look to Him, as He is seated on the right hand of the throne of God, keeps our hearts steady and our head free of stress when we go through the deep waters of affliction, problems and challenges. The Psalmist did not stop there, he went on to tell us what looking upon the Lord makes of us when he said: “And were radiant”. |Being radiant simply means to be vividly bright, shining and glowing. To have such an appearance in times of challenge means that, as we look upon the Lord in times of difficulties, troubles and challenges, we draw a divine radiance from God's own glory. This can be seen from what was written of Moses in Exodus chapter 34 at his return from receiving the Ten Commandments from God. The Bible says that: “When Moses went down from Mount Sinai carrying the Ten Commandments, his face was shining because he had been speaking with the LORD; but he did not know it. Aaron and all the people looked at Moses and saw that his face was shining, and they were afraid to go near him.” (Exodus 34:29-30). What a glory poured on us as we fixate our focus on our God. |In the Epistle of Apostle Paul to the church in Corinth, he also wrote about the effect of looking up to God in 2 Corinthians 3:16-18 that: “Whenever, though, they turn to face God as Moses did, God removes the veil and there they are—face-to-face! They suddenly recognize that God is a living, personal presence, not a piece of chiseled stone. And when God is personally present, a living Spirit, that old, constricting legislation is recognized as obsolete. We're free of it! All of us! Nothing between us and God, our faces shining with the brightness of his face. And so we are transfigured much like the Messiah, our lives gradually becoming brighter and more beautiful as God enters our lives and we become like him” (MSG). |The radiance that glows from our faces is the evidence that we have truly looked up to Him. In Isaiah 60:4-5, Prophet Isaiah used the word radiant to describe a mother's face lighting up at the sight of her children, long given up for lost. The radiance that our faces beam even in time of trouble is the reflection of God's glory rubbed on our faces as we look upon Him. As we keep our focus on Him even in times of trouble, problem and challenge, His glory upon our face will make our faces radiant, glowing with God's beauty and peace. The result is that while we are at peace, there is confusion for the enemy because the enemy can never understand the source of our beauty and peace. Hallelujah!"

      "message": "The above text talks of looking up to God and what happens to those who would look up to Him in all situations, particularly when in trouble or distress. May we continually look up to God. But for the purpose of individual's spirituality, let each one of us ask him\/herself the question: “Who do I look up to in time of trouble? A very religious person will say “to God of course”.  |Then the next question will be whether God sees that it is to Him and Him alone to they look up to. In 1 Kings 19:18, God said to Elijah that: “...I will leave 7,000 people alive in Israel; all those who are loyal to Me and have not bowed to Baal or kissed his idol.” If at this minute your heart tells you that if God says the same thing now, you won't be amongst the 7,000. All you need do now is turn to Him in repentance and ask for forgiveness and mercy. His mercy is renewed day by day. Plunge into the widened door of His mercy and begin to look to Him alone. He has the whole world including you in His hands and He loves you and already have Jesus as sacrifice for every man's sin. Therefore, wash in the blood of Jesus and take on the newness of His mercy so that the blessings of looking up to Him alone can be yours. |In many respects man  have passed through, and may be passing through challenges, difficulties and trials. And the experiences (i.e. the intention of the enemy) are always the same but with different facts. This is revealed to us by Our Lord Jesus Christ when He says in John 10:10 that the plan of the enemy is to kill, steal and destroy. Therefore, what we experience in difficulty is because the enemy has the same intention against every believer, but it comes in different ways. In Psalm 34:4a, the Psalmist talks of the first line of experience; which  is “man needing help from God” when man is in trouble.  |The troubles in which we find ourselves as humans range from different cultures and attacks of the enemy; which includes domestic trouble like issues with family member(s) being in trouble; challenges at work, a bereavement, financial difficulty or any other issues that would cause anxieties that we all are liable to. Because of anxiety, some have looked around rather than looking up, while in fear some looked down. But in every situation may we always find grace to look up in Jesus name (Psalm 121).  |When troubles and challenges come, I pray that we continue in the grace to look up to Him alone and not down or around in Jesus name. We will continue next week as we look at what happens as we look up."

      "message": "When we face problems and antagonisms that make us to wonder  whether there is going to be an end to their attacks, be rest assured that God sees it all and He is on top of the situation if you are in Him.  |There was a time in history that believers were being picked up and killed by king Herod. Believers were slaughtered or thrown to the lions for preys while the king and his apologists watched and laughed. Also in Biblical history,  Judah also had terrible attack from the Assyrians; and in Isaiah chapter 33 the Prophecy of Isaiah came with a warning of “Woe to you, destroyer, you who have not been destroyed! Woe to you, betrayer, you who have not been betrayed...” (NIV)  |The Assyrians of Bible time were extremely treacherous people. They were so wicked that they would often mutilate their prisoners of war, cutting off their tongues or gorging out their eyes. The cruel treatment of the captives of the Assyrians were so much that whenever the Assyrian army surrounded any city, the inhabitants of the city would commit suicide rather than to be taken captive by the Assyrians and be exposed to the humiliating torture of the Assyrians. Isaiah 33:1-8 reveals further that the Assyrians had also taken captive many of the people of the cities of Judah. But Judah knew what to do. Judah called on their God and God responded to Judah by revealing to Judah, what He would do to the Assyrians. God said: “Now I will act. I will show how powerful I am. You make worthless plans and everything you do is useless. My spirit is like a fire that will destroy you. You will crumble like rocks burnt to make lime, like thorns burnt to ashes. Let everyone near and far hear what I have done and acknowledge my power.” (Isaiah 33:10-13 GNB). God was going to burn the wicked enemy of His Children in His fire. This is how God will deal with our enemy because we are His Children, adopted through the precious Blood of Jesus. |Brethren, no matter the overwhelming attack of the enemy, we only need to call on God and trust Him. And the enemy that is mocking us today or saying our God cannot deliver us will all fail just as the Assyrian king failed as recorded in 2 Kings 18:28-35. With God on our side, the threat of the enemy is an empty threat. It is like the barking of a toothless bulldog. Our God is a consuming fire. (See Hebrews 12:29 and Psalm 97:3). The Lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed - Revelation 5:5. Therefore, no matter the attack of the enemy, stand on the Word of God. By the word and power of God, you will have the victory and, “Your Destroyer Will Be Destroyed.”"

In Zechariah 4:3, God said to the Prophet in a vision that, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit.' The work of God also needs resources, and not the resources of human might or power. |God says, “not by the resources of many or one, but by My Spirit.\"  |Any challenge or problem that confronts the children of God is never overcame by our cleverness, ability, physical strength or connection, but by the Spirit of God. This why God had to send down the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.  |The necessary resource for God's work is the Holy Spirit and God promised Zerubbabel a rich resource in the Spirit of God to accomplish His work. When we trust in our own resources or power or connection; whether they be small or great in the eyes of men, then we don't enjoy the full supply of the Spirit. God wanted Zerubbabel to know that the Holy Spirit would do all things. We too must know this. Whatever may be our need or challenge, we cannot rely on our strength, resources or connection but on God.  |In our text today, God promised that by His Spirit, what seemed like a great mountain before zerubabel would be leveled into a plain. The great mountain may have literally been the mountainous pile of rubbles at the temple site. That rubble would be removed and the work will go on and Zerubbabel shall bring forth the capstone with shouts of “Grace, grace to it!” This was God's assurance to Zerubbabel that not only would the work be finished, but Zerubbabel will  finish it, and declaring that it was all the work of grace. |When the work is done or a victory is won through human might or power man can take credit for it, but when it is done by the Power of God through the Holy Spirit, then it is all to the glory of God. |Brethren, what are you passing through? Have things happened in your life that you never believed they could happen? You never envisaged that such a challenge could ever come to you or one of your loved ones. You never thought you will find yourself in the situation that you or your loved ones have found yourself. But it happened. Brethren, cheer up. What you are going through form part of the realities of life and part of the ways of God to get you closer to Him for you to get to the top and fulfil your glorious destiny. Being a Christian does not mean a trouble free -life. We did not come to Christ so that we will not have troubles. But one thing is certain; the trouble will not have us because we have Christ. As Christ's property, the trouble cannot overwhelm us, rather God will make the way out that will make us to shout “Grace!!!” According to the Word of God, there is a future, and our hope will not be cut off. (Proverbs 23:18) |The Almighty God did not promise us smooth voyage but a very safe landing. The presence of Christ in the boat did not mean there could not be storms; but Christ will always command the storms to be still and they will obey; and Christ will take you safely to the shore. God said to Jacob: “Alas! for that day is great, There is none like it; It is the time of Jacob's [unequaled] trouble, But he will be saved from it.” (Jeremiah 30:7 AMP). |By the Mercy of God, and the Power of The Holy Spirit, that which you you are going through right now will end up in praise and uncommon testimonies. No matter what is happening right now, no matter the report or what the devil has concocted, be assured that what you are going through right now will not kill your destiny, rather it will end in praise. The mountain will be miraculously made plain and you and your family will greatly praise God. It will end in praise!"

      "message": "In Chapter 14 of 2 Chronicles, when Asa was king of Judah and the Ethiopians, with vast army numbering millions came against Judah who had just a few soldiers, this fearful army obviously posed a great threat to the kingdom of Judah who had an army of just a total of 580,000 men (2 Chronicles 14:8 GNB). The enemy's army was almost twice as large, but Judah had God. And Asa the king of Judah trusted in the power of God. Asa knew that God's power was not limited by the small army of Judah. Asa knew what God did for Judah under the reign of Abijah, his father in 2 Chronicles 13:3. And because he trusted in the power of God and not in the strength of the enemy or the smallness of his army, Asa cried out to the Lord his God and prayed.  |Asa understood that the power of God is not enhanced or limited by man's apparent strength or weakness. King Asa also recognised that this battle belonged to the Lord and so, he called upon God to defend His honour; his prayer was: “Lord, do not let man prevail against You”. |What Asa did was to remind God that he (Asa) knows that God has the entire responsibility to defend His Honour. And God answered instantly, because He is a God of His word. He will not only defend His children but will defend the Honour of His name. Hence He said in Isaiah 48:11 that: “For My own sake, for My own sake, I will do it; For how should My name be profaned? And I will not give My glory to another.” |Brethren, as children of God, never forget that God not only has all the powers to defend us and defend His name in our lives, but He has the responsibility to do so and He certainly will do so because He must be glorified in our lives. The battles we face in life as children of God are not ours but God's battles. The day we are born into the world, we are born into the battle field and the moment anyone gives his\/her life to Christ, the battle line is drawn. However, since we have the Jehovah Nisi as our God, victory is as sure as day will follow night.  |And so, because Asa called on His God to defend His honour, the Bible says in verse 12 that “...the LORD struck the Ethiopians and they fled before Asa”. God fought on behalf of King Asa and the kingdom of Judah. I pray that whatever may be the battle that we or any of our loved one is facing as we call on God, He will fight so effectively that all the enemy will be broken before the Lord and we will have the victory in Jesus name.  |Therefore brethren, whether with many or with a few as king Asa prayed, it is nothing for God to help. We only need to call on Him and He will fight and win the battle for us so that We can praise Him and honour will be unto His name alone. God fought for Asa and Judah, and they were not only delivered from the danger, they were also enriched. When the Lord fights and wins our battle for us He will also restore to us all that we might have lost. This is what the Word of God means in Romans 8:37 that we are more than conquerors in the Lord. God not only makes you the conqueror, He also restores to you in multiples, everything that you might have lost.  |So, let us call on Him today and throughout these twenty-one days of fasting and prayer and He will fight for us because, whether with many or with a few, God will always win the battle for His children.

The family also gathered to mourn the loss. This was during the time of Jesus, more than 2,000 years ago. And so, it is not different from how we grief till today. What brings grief is death, but the truth is that every man or woman on this planet earth will die one day and the death of one will affect another man, woman or child regardless of their nationality, wealth or status in life; just as it was a brother that had died in John Chapter 11; leaving behind  his two sisters by names Mary and Martha. They loved their brother very much and so were they very sad. |Lazarus also had friends, and one of them was our Lord Jesus Christ. So, Jesus was also affected by Lazarus' death. And so it was recorded in John 11:35 (shortest Bible verse) that: “Jesus wept.” Jesus had done and was well popular for all His miracles all over Israel and so when eventually Jesus arrived at the village of Bethany and the house of Lazarus,  Martha went out of the house to meet Jesus; and then made a bold statement that: “Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.”  |Brethren, just like Martha, in time of grief we also feel let down. Martha's statement was an expression of a feeling of let down by Jesus Christ because they had actually sent for Jesus a few days previously when Lazarus was sick (John11:1-7). But Jesus does not let anyone down. If He delays, or does nothing it is that God may be glorified. And, at such times that we think He did nothing or delayed, do we not also express the same words that Martha did? The words: “If only.” If only we had done something different. If only he\/she had gotten treatment earlier. If only I had …… If only God had ….. Brethren, the time comes when we must accept realities rather than fill our lives and world with the questions of “if only and if onlys”  |In this world bad things happen to all people, be they good or bad people. And in fact, bad things do happen to good people more than to those we perceive to be bad. Good people get sick, they have accidents, they have heart attacks and all manner of ills of life come to them. And so, sometimes good comes and sometimes bad comes. That is the world we live in. This we also see in the conversation of Job with his wife in Job 2:10 that: “Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble...?” (NIV). This is the reality of our existence. There are times we hope and pray that God would break in – “If only God would …” yet sometimes God would not change the order of things and we are hurt. |The good news however is that God does not ever leave His own without hope, just as we see in the story of Lazarus that Jesus did not leave Martha without hope. Jesus gave her a promise: “Your brother will rise again. Your brother will live again. Your brother will be with you again.” Such Promises would have brought some faint smile to the face of Martha. Brethren, in our moment of grief, let us bring to heart the truth of the Word of Jesus that somewhere in the future there will be no more pain, no more sorrow, no more disease; and this should bring a smile to our faces. It is the thought of a day when those who are true children and friends of God will live forever. Although, Martha had the same thought and responded that: “I know that Lazarus will rise again in the resurrection at the end of time.” (John11:24). But then, Jesus instantly said to her: “I am the resurrection. I am the life. Whoever believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live. Everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?” Martha acknowledged her belief in Jesus being the “...Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.” (Vs.27 NIV).  |In a moment of flash, Martha's life changed. She had started the day being confronted with the death of her brother, but she ended it with having eternal life in Christ. She started the day with doubts and sadness but she ended it with joy and assurance. This was because she put her faith in Jesus and it was the moment that everything changed for her, and she became full of hope, full of joy, even in the midst of her sadness. God touched her in a way that she had never been touched before. Martha believed in the Lordship of Jesus; Martha had faith in eternal life with Jesus. |Brethren, in times of grief, Christ is available for us to find Him. In the story of Lazarus, it is the miracle of the raising up of Lazarus from death that is often more focussed on; but of a truth, two miracles happened on that day. And the first was Martha's confession of her faith in Christ and this gave her eternal life. This is the more important of the two miracles. At the time of the grief of the loss of a loved one, it is important for us to check our faith. For us to search our hearts and ask ourselves the question that Martha answered. Do we believe in Jesus' promise that: Whoever believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live. Everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.\" Are we living in Him? If we believe, then we have hope; If we believe, then we have eternal life. But if you have not believed in Him, it is not too late. Today you can call on Jesus, and say to Him, \"Yes Lord I believe.\" Ask him to come into your life and when you do a miracle will take place and you will receive the promise of eternal life. Because, whether it is now or hundred years to come, every human being is going to die one day and everyone will face eternal life. But whether you will spend it with Christ or not will be dependent on your belief in Him or not. I pray that the Almighty God will strengthen everyone going through a moment of grief. But, in our moment of grief, let us find Christ."

      "message": "We live in a very snobbish world and a bullying society. There are also people who either just take delight in making life difficult for others or they just want others never to be able to stand up to them. While some others just like to mock their fellow men and never seeing any good in them; even when those ones are putting their best humanly possible efforts. Therefore, the snobbish and bullish people will always do everything to down play the strengths and opportunities of the others. This can certainly be very painful; especially when their best are met with other people's destructive and negative attitudes towards them. |The ultimate of these negativities is that the bullies will always put insults upon the injuries already created by them.  And so, King David in our text today questioned that: “How long will people continue in their negativity?\" The Bible gives us the situation that Daniel found himself in Babylon as an example of the evil that men can do against another just because that other is doing good. In Babylon, Daniel showed himself as an exceptional leader in the Empire. And for His exceptional qualities they sought to bring him down (See: (Daniel 6: 3-5). |In the song, “In Christ Alone”, the Composer of that song wrote: “This gift of love and righteousness; Scorned by the ones He came to save”. The people we are trying to help are often the ones who join forces to attack us. Therefore, when we go through this type of battle, we need not be surprised; but only seek the wisdom of God and guidance on how to handle the bullies. And how to handle such bullies and conquer them is by the power of God through His word. At such times, the word of the Psalmist in verse 4 of today's text wherein he said: “...know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to him\" comes in aid. |May be you are facing unwarranted antagonism and insult and like king David, you are asking: “How long will this continue...?' I have good news for you. No matter the bully and antagonism, according to the word of God, you will have victory because God has set you apart for Himself and He has promised to answer when you call Him. He will surely answer. He will lift His countenance upon you as stated in verse 7 and He will bring you an exceptional result no matter the circumstances.  |Brethren, God's presence in our lives as His children will always bring about exceptional results that will silence all the snobbish attitudes of the bullies and mockers. And, when He does, nobody will be able to argue with or ignore God's positive results in our lives in Jesus name. And when God's result manifests, then like the Psalmist, we will sing: “When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream (Psalms 126:1). We will laugh and others will also recognise what God has done for us and they too will acknowledge the great things that God has done for us. Brethren, I encourage us to stand on the word of God and trust Him, like Daniel trusted, like shadrach Meshach and Abednego trusted, and like Joseph also trusted God; and all of them had the last say, we will have the last say because God's result will  terminate man's insult in the lives, families and careers of His children."

Believers were slaughtered or thrown to the lions for preys while the king and his apologists watched and laughed. Also, in Biblical history,  Judah also had terrible attack from the Assyrians; and in Isaiah chapter 33 the Prophecy of Isaiah came with a warning of “Woe to you, destroyer, you who have not been destroyed! Woe to you, betrayer, you who have not been betrayed...” (NIV)  |The Assyrians of the Bible time were extremely treacherous people. They were so wicked that they would often mutilate their prisoners of war, cutting off their tongues or gorging out their eyes. The cruel treatment of the captives of the Assyrians were so much that whenever the Assyrian army surrounded any city, the inhabitants of the city would commit suicide rather than to be taken captives by the Assyrians and be exposed to the humiliating torture of the Assyrians. Isaiah 33:1-8 revealed further that the Assyrians had also taken captive many of the people of the cities of Judah. But Judah knew what to do. Judah called on their God and God responded to Judah by revealing to Judah, what He would do to the Assyrians. God said: “Now I will act, I will show how powerful I am. You make worthless plans and everything you do is useless. My spirit is like a fire that will destroy you. You will crumble like rocks burnt to make lime, like thorns burnt to ashes. Let everyone near and far hear what I have done and acknowledge my power” (Isaiah 33:10-13 GNB). God was going to burn the wicked enemy of His Children in His fire. This is how God will deal with our enemies because we are His Children, adopted through the precious Blood of Jesus. |Brethren, no matter the overwhelming attack of the enemy, we only need to call on God and trust Him. And the enemy that is mocking us today or saying our God cannot deliver us will all fail just as the Assyrian king failed as recorded in 2 Kings 18:28-35. With God on our side, the threats of the enemy is an empty threat. It is like the barking of a toothless bulldog. God is a consuming fire. (See Hebrews 12:29 and Psalm 97:3). The Lion of the tribe of Judah has already prevailed - Revelation 5:5 |Therefore, no matter the attack of the enemies, stand on the Word of God. By the word and power of God you will have the victory and your destroyer will be destroyed in Jesus name."

      "message": "The definitions of taste are: (1) the flavour of something, or (2) the ability of a person or animal to recognize different flavours: |In Psalm 34:8, King David writes: “taste and see”. Why did he not say that we should “see and taste?” The answer is found in what Jesus said to one of His disciples called Thomas in John 20:29 , \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\" |To taste before you have the time to see is a matter of trust, faith and reliance. I have heard of new restaurants holding what is called tasting session whereby they invite people to attend the tasting sessions. It simply an invitation to have a taste of their delicacies freely and enjoy it, and thereby keep coming back for more. It is assumed that once you taste their food, you will come back for more.  This can be likened to our text of today. The Word says: “Taste And See That The Lord Is Good.”  |To “taste” God is to experience His goodness, His Mercy and His love when we can truly trust Him, and He shows forth His power over our situations in an amazing way. It also means that we take a leap of faith; and something that validates the love of God for us and His power of deliverance happen to us.  |Prior to your tasting God, there is always an old expression of doubt. This is the kind of Thomas's doubt in  John 20:25. Because we cannot see God, the subconscious pushes man to only believe in the things that we can see.  |The life of any believer in Christ is a matter of trust. Always trusting God no matter the situation because we cannot see the future; but God can. And He already says in Romans 10:11 that: “...Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.\"  |And so, trusting our lives and future to the One who holds that future is the only sane decision that man should actually take.  |No matter how much any other person talks about how sumptuous a meal is or how sweet the pudding is, such can only stir out taste buds; it can never translate to our own experience. Therefore King David says, take a step of faith! Trust in this God (because I have)! And you will see that He is good. King David is saying: Try Him out. Just like you would be invited to taste the meals in a new restaurant; and He affirmatively says you will see that God is good.  |Psalm 34 is a Psalm of praise and a Psalm of thanksgiving, but it's also a Psalm of invitation. David wrote Psalm 34 just after he had been saved from a situation where death seemed likely (see 1 Samuel 21) David was saved and he is full of praises to God. David knew that there were others who were also suffering, others who were afflicted and some others who are in one kind of problem or the other, but who in doubt of God's care for them. And so he is appealing to such people to turn to God and see that He is a good God.  |Brethren, are you in any kind of problem or challenge take to the invitation of king David. The only credential you need is to be connected to Him through Christ Jesus, the Messiah and you will not be disappointed. If God has spoken a word concerning your situation, take the Word, hold unto it in the name of Jesus and your testimony will be so amazing that you will be the next Andrew in John 1:40 or the next king David in Psalm 34:8; inviting others to God through Jesus Christ; so that they too can “Taste and see that God is good” and Jesus is real."

Paul not only desired to know the power of Christ, but also have a fellowship of Christ's sufferings. The GNB says “to share in His sufferings”. Knowing Jesus therefore also means knowing His power and the fellowship of His sufferings. Jesus suffered that humanity can be reconciled to God through Him. Being children of God, believers and followers of Christ therefore makes that suffering of Christ part of our heritage. We must truly  be part of the family of suffering.  |In Romans 8:17, Apostle Paul made this point of the power and sufferings of Christ parts of our heritage when he wrote that: “...if children, then heirs' of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with Him in order that we may also be glorified with him.” What are those sufferings? They include being rejected because we would not bow to the world standard and all political correctness that contradicts the word of God, just as Christ was rejected even by the so called leaders of religion.  |His sufferings that we share in also includes daring to stand on the side of God and the truth even as Shadrach Meshack and Abednego did; even in the face of threat of death and they were bold to king Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel 3:16-18 says: “Your threat means nothing to us. If you throw us in the fire, the God we serve can rescue us from your roaring furnace and anything else you might cook up, O king. But even if he doesn't, it wouldn't make a bit of difference, O king. We still wouldn't serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” Daniel 3:16-18 (MSG). In the little corner of our professions, occupations, vocations, callings, jobs, employments, careers and businesses, how much are we willing to share in the sufferings of Christ by refusing to conform with the world?  |This was the desire of Apostle Paul who said of himself when he spoke about the real believers in Philippians 3:3-6. If we are more controlled by our impressive credentials and influences and would rather compromise Faith than loosing them, Apostle Paul then talks of his pedigree that: “though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more...” (vs.4). He goes on to say that he was circumcised on the eighth day, being an Israelite, that he is of the tribe of Benjamin, he is a Hebrew of Hebrews; and that when it comes to the law, he is a Pharisee. That he was so zealous about everything Jewish that he persecuted the church. And that when it comes to righteousness under the law, he was blameless. (Vs.5-6)  |He concluded by saying in verses 7-8 that: “The very credentials these people are waving around as something special, I'm tearing up and throwing out with the trash, along with everything else I used to take credit for. And why? Because of Christ. Yes, all the things I once thought were so important are gone from my life. Compared to the high privilege of knowing Christ Jesus as my Master, firsthand, everything I once thought I had going for me is insignificant—dog dung. I've dumped it all in the trash so that I could embrace Christ and be embraced by him. (MSG) |That is the fellowship of His sufferings. Are we doing that as believers of today? I pray that we will truly be prepared to suffer for the sake of Him who suffered for us to be reconciled to God and experience His power."

There are many ways to reach out to people and help shoulder their loads, so to speak. Just by giving an encouraging word or smile, we can help lighten the loads for someone.

We can pay someone's child's school fees or even give someone cash to help the family, as long as you have the means. And anytime we help others with reaching out to their needs, the scripture says we are directly lending a hand to God Himself (Proverbs 19:17). |The story of Prophet Elijah is a typical example. God said to Elijah: “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you” (1 kings 17:9). God prepared a widow to feed Elijah because God's intention was to use Elijah to prosper the widow. |Today, consider those that God has positioned in your life for you to be of help to them; to lift up their hands just as Aron lifted up the hands of Moses in the battle against the Amalekites in Exodus 17:12-14.

      "bibleRef": "“The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want” (Psalms 23:1 NKJV)",
      "message": "Psalm 23 is a great Psalm which a lot of us know like we know the back of our hands. And in fact, a lot of unbelievers also know and quote, at least, the first verse which is our main text of today. |Reading through the whole of Psalm 23 and meditating on each verse, one can see that there are some blessings revealed by the Psalmist as that which would come the way of any believer who allows God to be his\/her shepherd. We will look at all the blessings as time goes by, as they cannot all be compressively discussed in one day. |The first is seen in verse 1 which says that: “The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want”. This first verse is an assurance of provision. When we talk of provision, people tend to look in the direction of financial or material provisions. But the assurance in verse 1 is beyond that. This assurance stems from what God did at creation as revealed in Genesis 1:3, 6, 9-10, 11, 14-18, 19-21 and 25-26; wherein God made complete provisions for everything that man will need for his life and his survival. And it was after all these were in place that God made man in Genesis 1:26 and also gave the man dominion over all the other things that He had created. In other words God made provisions and located man in and over all that He provided. Man had no impute as to how these things came about. |The Amplified Bible Version of Psalm 23:1 says the Lord is my shepherd: “...to feed, to guide and to shield me”. Since man did not have a hand in how the provisions came about, man certainly would need the maker for him to be able to actualise them. Psalm 23:1 is therefore an assurance of what we will have both physically, materially, and spiritually when the Lord is our shepherd. And since the shepherd is the maker of these things in the first place, He alone knows where all the necessities of life are located and He alone can lead His sheep to them. There is an absolute need for us to allow God to be our shepherd lest we continue to struggle without having the fullness of what God has provided for man before man was made. And so the Psalmist says, when He is our shepherd, we will not lack anything. |Brethren, consider the sheep and their shepherd. The Psalmist being a shepherd right from the youth knows that as a shepherd, he is responsible for everything the sheep needs to be alive, to be healthy and to look good. Therefore, he says that when you allow God to be the shepherd of your life, you will have no lack for anything; and not lacking in anything means having everything. We need to ask for mercy of God in the so many ways that, even after accepting Jesus as the Lord and Saviour of our lives, we have strayed away like a lost sheep. We have continued to struggle on our own and not allowing Him to be the shepherd of our lives. And so, despite all our struggles and strivings, most of us do not have much to show for it financially, materially and physically or even spiritually. All because, we have not allowed the shepherd to be in total control. Jesus says in Matthew 6:33 that we should seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and every other thing will be added to us. Seeking first the kingdom of God is the acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Saviour, while His righteousness is our total submission to God's leading just as the sheep does in total submission to the shepherd. And when this is not there, we short-changed ourselves. May Lord have mercy on us. |Also, in the Old Testament, Moses revealed the mind of God to the children of Israel that God says: “all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you if you will obey God.” (Deuteronomy 28:2). What are these blessings? They include what Jesus revealed in Matthew 6:31 as the things that all men are anxious about i.e. \"What shall we eat?\" or \"What shall we drink?\" or \"What shall we wear?\" All these things can truly be our source of concern and sometimes burden to any human being. And no matter how much we labour, they can never be fully met or satisfied by our human strength or wisdom. Because until a man drops dead, man's physical, material and financial needs can never be fully met or satisfied. And so man on his own, like a run away sheep, keeps striving but never having enough. This is what brings stress to a man's life and makes him depressed. May the Lord open our understanding. |The Psalmist therefore found and revealed the secret to having satisfaction; which is, just to allow the Lord to be our shepherd. So that, when we allow God to be our shepherd, there can never be a lack of anything in our lives, since the Shepherd alone knows where the supply is located. And so in Psalm 103:5, the Psalmist further reveals that God will feel our lives with good things. On this Easter Sunday, let us allow God to be our shepherd."

Apostle Paul wrote to the Roman Christians like us that: “...For the Scripture says, \"Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame\" - Romans 10:11). Apostle Paul's letter is so clear and direct. He also wrote to the Galatian Christians that “...if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). |In Christ, we become joint heirs to every promise of God to the children of Israel. Promises that includes: that we will not be put to shame. This means God in His might and power, and for His own name sake, will prevent the shame that the enemy intends; just as He promises in Isaiah 48:11, that: “For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it, for how should my name be profaned? My glory I will not give to another.” The Lord recognises that it is with a price that He redeemed us (1 Corinthians 6:20). Therefore, He and He alone will take the glory, not the devil. |Brethren, whatever may be the challenges that we are facing at the moment, however long the battle might have been on, no matter the length of our waiting; as long as we believe in the eternal and everlasting  God that determines the end from the beginning for all those who trust in Him; the storyline will end in our favour and for His praise. And, just as Prophet Joel puts it in Joel 2:27, we will know that He that is in the midst of Israel is your God and you will never be put to shame. And instead of the shame that the enemy planned and orchestrated, instead of dishonor, they shall rejoice in our lot; and we will have everlasting joy (Isaiah 61:7). |What the main scripture of today reveals through prophet Isaiah, is the same thing that Apostle Paul quotes in Romans 10:11. Therefore, His promises have never failed nor has He ever changed His Word. Examples abound of people of old who firmly trusted God and their faces were never ashamed. (See Genesis 37:18-36 and 43:5-7; Exodus 14: 10-31; Daniel 3:19-23, 28-30; 6:16-17, 26-28). |Let us keep trusting the only unfailing God who has never failed anyone; and He will never fail. Our victory is just round the corner. Marianne Williamson is quoted as saying: “Behind every dark cloud there is an every-shining sun. Just wait. In time, the cloud will pass.” |For us as believers, our shinning sun is Jesus Christ in us and He has already overcome darkness, difficulties and all manners of challenges for us. Hence, John's revelation explicitly says: “...Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed..” (Revelation 5:5). |Brethren, we serve the God that says: “...I am the LORD your God and there is none else...”(Joel 2:27). We will trust Him, we will be the victors in the end and it will never end in shame, disgrace or sorrow that the enemy has planned, in Jesus name."

      "message": "“Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, “How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!” But the people were completely silent” (1 Kings 18:21 NLT). |Open option is simply freedom to choose. Without freedom of choice, obedience is not true obedience but compulsion. We therefore cannot truly claim to be obedient and neither can one be accused of disobedience when there is no option of choice. In the first text, Joshua told the people to choose whom they will serve. But he already made his choice to serve the Lord. We see another example in the second text where the Prophet Elijah asked the people: “How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him!” (NLT). The Bible records that nobody answered him. The reason is that they could not make up their mind on the choice to follow God or Baal? |From the start of humanity as seen in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had freedom to choose. This is because if God was not giving them the option to choose between obedience and disobedience, God wouldn't have put the tree of life in a reachable position for them. God is God, He knew they will be tempted with the forbidden fruit, He however gave them the option to choose to obey without being compelled but out of love and reverence for God, or do otherwise (Genesis 2:17). The first humans blew the freedom to choose and today man continues to do the same until when one totally commits Himself to God through Christ, the only one who is worthy. |In the story of Elijah and the people of Israel, in 1 Kings 18:21, the Bible describes a crucial moment of decision. It was the final showdown between the God of Israel and a false god called Baal. And so Elijah calls God's people to choose once and for all between the living God who delivered them, and the false god who has captured their affections. But the people seemed unable or unwilling to make a choice. They want to hedge their bets, sit on the fence and keep their options open. Joshua also chose to obey God alone in serving Him. |Brethren, what challenges are you confronted with that Satan is suggesting the other option to you? Let us not be like the Israelites in the time of Elijah who wanted to be on the fence. That in itself, is an indirect rejection of God. The enemy will always make the other option look good, attractive or rewarding, but the wise king Solomon says of such that: “There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death.”(Proverbs 14:12). We will not be destroyed in Jesus name. |Brethren, to refuse to choose obedience to God and allow Him to be the Master over our lives is to choose slavery to sin. This is what Apostle Paul points out in his letter to Titus in Titus 3:3 that: “For we also once were foolish ourselves, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another”. |The two options i.e. obedience or disobedience have its consequences; and a lot of time, we find ourselves suffering under the consequences of those choices we have made in life that were not in line with obedience to the word of God. See Deuteronomy 30:15-20. May we always have the grace to choose rightly through the power of Jesus Christ, who used Himself as example of obedience and says: “If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love (John 15:10). |Today, let us choose to walk in obedience continually and we will easily appropriate into our lives all the blessings that God has prepared for us. The open option of choice to obey is good because God desires that whoever comes to Him comes wholeheartedly and not by compulsion. May we willingly choose to obey God in Jesus name. Amen."

      "bibleRef": "“And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, \"Because you did not believe in me, to uphold me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them\" (Numbers 20:12 NLT).",
      "message": "Moses is hailed as the leader of the Exodus; he being the one through whom God delivered the children of Israel. In fact, in Deuteronomy 34:10-12, it was recorded of Moses that there is “none like him for all the signs and the wonders that the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land, and for all the mighty power and all the great deeds of terror that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.” Yet, he could not achieve that singular thing that all Israelites look up to: “Getting to the promise land.” Why not?The Bible did not leave us oblivious of God's reasons, in Deuteronomy 32:51-52, God said to Moses: “For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You failed to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel there. So you will see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel”(Deuteronomy 32:51-52. |The incident referred to by the Almighty God at at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh was recorded in Numbers chapter 20. When after wandering in the wilderness for almost 40 years, the Israelites came to the Wilderness of Zin. There was no water, and the people's anger turned against Moses and Aaron. They (Moses and Aaron) then went to the tent of meeting, prostrated before God and God responded to them and told them to gather the assembly and “speak” to the rock and water would come forth. But what did Moses do? The Bible says that Moses actually gathered the people as instructed, he took the staff as instructed but, seemingly in anger, Moses said to the people: “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” Moses then struck the rock twice with his staff (Numbers 20:10-11). Water actually came out from the rock, in line with what God had promised. But, Moses action did not please God. And, God said to Moses and Aaron that, “…Because you didn't “trust” me, didn't treat me with holy reverence in front of the People of Israel, you two aren't going to lead this company into the land that I am giving them”(Numbers 20:12). The key words here are: “Trust & Honour.\" Are we, as children of God not guilty of same today? |God desires that we trust Him. Although Moses' punishment may appear harsh to us, but, when we look closely we can see several mistakes of Moses which many of us are guilty of today. The most obvious of these mistakes is disobedience. Moses disobeyed God's direct command to “Speak” to the rock when he struck the rock with his staff. There have been other instance where God had brought water from a rock by instructing Moses to strike it with a staff in Exodus chapter 17. But at Meribah, there was a clear instruction to speak to the rock. To God, this was lack of trust in God and failure to Honour Him before the people. |Brethren, there is a promise land for every child of God born through the precious Blood of Jesus, but God requires our trust in Him. When we trust Him totally as we bring Honour to him before people of very little or no faith. God did not want Moses to use force; which would have meant his strength. He only needed to Trust God and obey God; knowing that God would always be true to His promise. When Moses said to the people: “Must we bring you water out of this rock?, in Numbers 20:10, he seemed to be taking for himself and Aron, the credit for the miracle instead of attributing it to God. As children of God, we must learn to trust God and Honour Him before men and bring them to trust God as well. The ESV version of the Bible puts the instruction as follows: “Take the staff, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water” (Numbers 20:8). To tell the Rock could have meant a picture of prayer. Brethren, like Moses, how many times do we fret rather than pray in the face of challenges? |God has given us Jesus Christ as the water-giving Rock that we must trust as recorded in 1 Corinthians 10:4 that: “…they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them, and that rock was Christ.” Failure to trust God amounts to disobedience, pride, and failure to acknowledge Christ's sacrifice through whom we receive salvation. We all have a promise land for each of God's children, but God requires us to trust Him. By so doing we bring honour to Him before men. I pray that whatever we have been looking unto God for, we will totally trust and obey Him, no matter how loud the negatives being shouted by the world around us. God is faithful and ever faithful. By Mercy, we will get Our Promise Land."

      "message": "In John 1:43-51, we read about Nathaniel and how Philip found him and told him about Jesus. When Philip called Nathaniel about Jesus of Nazareth, we see that Nathaniel's response was a sceptic one. A kind of scepticism which can be interpreted as doubt.  This interpretation is deduced from how Philip responded that: “if you doubt, you need to come and see”. Philip was saying that Nathaniel needed to see before he could believe that his perception of Nazareth has nothing to do with who Jesus Christ is. Perception can be misleading. |Brethren; are you worried about men's perception of you? It happened to Jesus, don't be worried. If your heart is right with God in all that you do, the wrong perception of men has no place with God. Just keep doing the right thing and doing your good work for the glory of God. There can only be danger for where you have the general perception of men that what you are doing is good; and so you fail to see how God sees your heart. God sees and knows everyone's heart no matter the perception of men. When God sees your heart as something else from what cronies are saying to you; it's time to run to the Lord in repentant humility and ask Him to recreate you with His redemptive  power of recreation. |God says: \"I the LORD search the heart and test the mind...\" (Jeremiah 17:10 ESV). Also in the house Jesé the father of David, when Samuel considered Eliab because of Eliab's looks; God told Prophet Samuel not to look on his appearance or the height of his stature and that: “...the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart.\" (1 Samuel 16:7 ESV). In our text today, Jesus saw Nathaniel differently because Jesus considers not appearance but the heart. Brethren, how or what people especially cronies say to you about yourself is irrelevant to how and what the Almighty God knows of you. It is what God knows of you that counts when the chips are down.   |God looks at the heart not the height or position, therefore don't allow people who are cronies or your position deceive you. Be conscious of the fact that everyone's end journey in life is to be accountable to God; and God does not look at position or glamour created by position, but God looks at the heart. The Psalmist explains the man that will dwell in God's holy hill in Psalm 24:3. Whether you are a Minister of God or a Minister of the Government, or even a student or an office messenger, or what ever your position may be, God knows who you really are. And whatever man says to you contrary to what God sees is mere deceit by the devil to get you destroyed in the end. |Jesus taught us what God expects of us in Matthew 5:16 that: “...let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven”. What Jesus said of Nathaniel in our text today is: “...a man in whom there is no deceit”. Brethren, in the position that God has placed you, what does God knows about you? No matter what the praise of men may be, it is what God knows of you that is important. Will Jesus say of you that this is a man\/woman in whom there is no deceit? The Psalmist prayed to God in Psalm 139:23 asking God to examine him and look at his heart and for God to lead him on the eternal path (CEB). May God lead us all to eternal path. How does God sees your heart?"

      "message": "When man speaks, they say: “trust me”. If man can say trust me, when in fact God warns us from trusting man, because man can change like weather, how can we not completely trust God. We are not put our trust in a man because the world that we live in is a world of broken promises. It is common thing to find politicians make all manner of promises when seeking elective offices only to turn away from what they promised as soon as they get there. We have also seen that marriages end over trivial disputes. Siblings turn away from each other; friends betray themselves etc.; and people's lives have been shattered as a result of broken promises. In Numbers 23:19, Balam declares to Balak that: “God is not a man, so he does not lie. He is not human, so he does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act? Has he ever promised and not carried it through?” (Numbers 23:19 NLT). |Trust also means the “firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something.” It is only God that can be so trusted. His promises are based on Himself and His unfailing love for man. This is why the writer of the Book of Hebrews says that: “So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us” (Hebrews 6:18 NLT). The text of today reveals that the Holy Spirit that God fills us with is God's first instalment that guarantees everything He has promised us. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. As such God gives Himself as the guarantee for His promises. |Brethren, is there anything that is of any challenge in your life and you have done all that is within your power, and man has even failed you, as they would. It is time to turn it to God and trust Him. Take time to look into the scriptures for His Word that meets your situation. Stay on the Word, claim it and keep trusting God. He cannot fail. He has never failed. He says: \"I am the Lord, and I do not change. That is why you descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed” (Malachi 3:6 NLT). Brethren, the same promise is for us today through Jesus Christ's redemptive work. As written in Galatians 3:29 that:  “...if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.” Therefore tell all to God today and Trust Him. That which the enemy intends for your destruction will fail because it failed from the moment Jesus was substituted for you on the cross of Calvary. |Therefore, trust God because the Holy Spirit is the first instalment that guarantees everything He has promised us. On this holy day, begin to express your love for God by your firm trust in Him. He alone can be trusted."

When God does this, His name is honoured and glorified and the lives of His Children are beautified. |Because of disobedience, honour and glory are part of the things that Satan stole from man, but Jesus took it from the enemy and gave it back to man. And, as believers, even when an unbeliever is in authority, we must continue to keep giving honour to God the author of all positions for allowing such persons to be in power, even though they do not deserve the position. Jesus said to Pilate: “...You would have no authority over Me, unless it had been given you from above; for this reason he who delivered Me to you has the greater sin\" (John 19:11). Also, the Psalmist says “For not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert comes exaltation...” (Psalms 75:6 AMP).

His Word says “... the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end, it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay (Habakkuk 2:3). God promised to deliver the children of Israel from slavery and one day, the appointed time came and Pharaoh and all his power was buried in the Red Sea.

The wicked man in power does not honour God, and certainly God's word must be fulfilled that such persons are insignificant and contemptible. So let the believer keep honouring God. Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego all honoured God, despite the wicked man in power, and  in the end, they, i.e. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were promoted because God must be honoured in the lives of His children. |Brethren, the inheritance is for us as believers to be honoured, therefore as we honour God in an uncomfortable situation or under an ungodly authority, He will honour Himself in our lives.

      "message": "Countless of stories are told of answered prayers revealing testimonies of diseases cured, illnesses healed, forgiveness granted, relationships restored, hungry children fed, great deliverance experienced, bills paid, debts cancelled and lives and souls saved through the efficacy of prayer. So, we do have real proofs that God answers prayer. But because most of these evidences are personal; many who think of “evidence” as being only observable, measurable and reproducible proofs cannot understand how faith people live by the notion that God answers prayers. The truth however remains that God answers to your prayers. |The main text of today is Jesus' word and this is the same thing that the Psalmist revealed in Psalm 50:15 where God says “call on me and I will answer.” Brethren, God is God, He is not dependent on anyone. If He says it, surely He will do it. As long as you are able to pray to Him and you believe in His ability to answer your prayer. This is why the writer of the Book of Hebrews says: “...for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him (Hebrews 11:6). If God says “call on me...I will answer” and Jesus Christ also says “Ask and you will receive”; brethren, that thing which you have asked in prayer is a done deal. Every prayer you pray in this victory month will equally be answered. Whatever the enemy tries to show you after you have prayed is a distraction of the enemy that must be ignored; look on God's word and not what the enemy is showing you. Therefore, as we wait for His answer to our prayers, He will surely answer us. Because His word shall not return to Him void” (Isaiah 55:11). This means His promise to answer our prayers will never return to Him unfulfilled. And nothing can change it. Hence, John in his letter explained that: “...whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep His commandments and do what pleases Him (1 John 3:22). That which pleases God is your faith. Because our faith is the proof that we know that He cannot lie, we know that He does not fail in His promises; we know that since He gave us Jesus, there is nothing He would not give. And so, our faith pleases Him and it brings forth answers to our answers. (Romans 8:32). |Because God answers prayers, we see that: (1) Elijah prayed for fire from heaven and it came down in 2 Kings 1:12; (2), Hezekiah prayed for deliverance and He received it in 2 Kings 19:19-20; (3) the Apostles prayed for boldness and they were emboldened in Acts 4:29; (4) Gideon prayed to see signs and God showed him signs as recorded in Judges 6:33-40; (5) Our Lord Jesus Christ prayed and gave thanks to God and called Lazarus from death to life and Lazarus came forth (John 11:38-44). Jesus also healed diverse of diseases and infirmities by calling on God. The Bible says that these examples were written by eyewitnesses to the events, they are therefore clear evidence of answered prayers (1 Corinthians 10:11). |Brethren, whatever you have been looking onto God for in the past year, trust Him to answer in this victory month of fasting and prayer, He has you on His agenda because you dared to ask Him, He will surely do it. Remember that He is your creator and He will do it earlier than you expected to give you perfect peace. Trust God, He answers prayers and He will surely answer yours. And, because you trust God and wait on Him alone this season, the time for your favour is now (Psalms 102:13). Hallelujah!"

      "message": "A gift is usually something you did not purchase with your money, something you did not work for, something which the giver spent quality time to buy, wraps or packages beautifully and presents to you. A gift is something which the giver thinks about before buying, considers it to be precious, of good quality and valuable. It is something that first comes from the heart because the giver thinks of you before and at the time he\/she buys it. However, no matter how precious or expensive the gift may be; no matter the good intention of the giver, the gift is not complete until it is received by the recipient and the value is not appreciated until it is unwrapped. And it is also after it has been unwrapped and appreciated that the recipient derives pleasure from: (1) the fact of being loved and appreciated, (2) that the gift is now his\/her own priced possession. |A gift can also be something you have  been given the opportunity to choose and tell the giver this is what I want for my birthday or graduation or even Christmas. But even though you specifically asked for that particular thing as gift, and even at that, you still have to unwrap, before it can truly be appreciated and get the satisfaction of “yes, I got what I wanted.” Whether the gift is what we ask for or what the giver decides to present as a gift, on getting to the recipient it will be unwrapped. But leaving our gifts under the Christmas tree or just somewhere in the corner of our room would not do the us any good because we would most likely never appreciate the gift and the giver unless we take the time to unwrap it. |In the same manner, Jesus Christ is the gift from the Almighty God to man, and wrapped up in Him are the good things of life. The scripture says: His Divine Power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness...” (2 Peter 1:3 ESV). God's gifts for us are all there, wrapped up in His Word. His Word is Jesus Christ (John 1:1). We receive Christ as gift from God when we accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour. However, we “unwrap” Him on daily basis as we meditate on the Word (Jesus) and obey what He commands. Just like the gifts we receive during celebrations; it is one thing to unwrap them, but another thing to appreciate it by turning it to our priced possession that we admire and make use of for our pleasure. For instance, a book is given to us for birthday or graduation, we not only unwrap it, we read and keep reading it; same for any other material thing we receive as gifts. And anytime we take the gift, our hearts go to the giver. |Today, we thank God that we have accepted Jesus as our Lord and Saviour; we praise His Holy Name, but the question is, how well are we enjoying the benefit of everything that pertains to life, wrapped up in Him for us. How well do we daily meditate and live by Him to enjoy Him. |But if you have not received this gift, today is another chance. Call Him into Your life to be your Lord and Saviour, and begin to daily unwrap Him through His Word. Don't allow a single day to pass without going into His Word so you can live live by it. For, in His Word we have  good health, peace of mind, victory, provision, protection, prosperity, promotion, long life etc. This is what Jesus Christ means when He says, He has come to give us abundant life. Jesus is the precious gift of God to us. May you receive the grace to daily appreciate the precious gift."

      "message": "Psalm 102 reveals that the Psalmist went through deep affliction that really overwhelmed him. He poured out his heart to God because he had steadfast confidence that God would act and show him mercy again. In verse 8-10 of this Psalm, in pouring out his heart to God, the Psalmist said even his enemies are mocking him day after day and cursed him; and that he ate ashes for food (i.e. mourning); and tears running down into his drink. That affliction was so deep that he concluded that the affliction was because of God's anger and wrath against him. He even said God had picked him up and thrown him out. |Brethren, affliction is another weapon that the enemy employs to oppress  the children of God. This is why the Preacher says in Ecclesiastes 7:7a that “Surely oppression makes a wise man mad...” Affliction comes in diverse ways, but no matter the affliction in your life, I pray that today, the power of God will arise and deliver you, because your set time is now in Jesus name. |The affliction that the Psalmist faced came from more than just poor health his enemies also set against him; he was constantly rejected and disapproved and mocked. Thomas Hartwell Horne, a Bible Theologian of the 18th century explained verse 8 in the following words: “The scoffs and reproaches of men are generally added to the chastisements of God; or rather, perhaps are a part, and sometimes the bitterest part of them.” I pray that God will show us mercy in any affliction that has come to us because of God's chastisement in Jesus name. This was why in 2 Samuel chapter 24:10-17, when God gave David three options of punishment for his sin, David said in Vs. 14 that: “...Let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man.\" Charles Spurgeon, the great Baptist Preacher also explained Vs.10 to mean that the Psalmist felt that God was treating him as wrestlers treat one another, when a man deliberately lifts up his opponent in order that he may give him the worse fall. It is a fact that God would sometimes allow the enemy to afflict one by way of His punishment. Therefore, I pray that in anyway that we or our family is being afflicted as a result of our own wrong doing, God will show us mercy now according to verse 13 in Jesus name. |The Psalmist recognises that no matter how far a man has gone in his infraction against God's word, the Almighty God endures forever in remembrance of His name to all generations. We too can turn to God and ask Him in remembrance of His name to show us mercy. Because no matter the numbers of days of man's affliction, God's mercy endures forever waiting for man to repent. And this is why the Psalmist can reject every self-reliance and held on to true reliance on God and calling on Him to remember His name to all generations and when the victory comes, His name will be declared. And as seen in the main text of today, the Psalmist confesses that God will arise and have mercy on Zion. Even though, he was in deep affliction, the Psalmist had steadfast confidence that God would act and show mercy once again. And that the set time has come. For everything that we ask from God, be it breakthrough, deliverance or healing, God has a set time for us. He has a set time for our restoration and so He would not forever leave us in desolation. |Brethren, just as there was an appointed time for the Jews in Babylon, and when the weeks were fulfilled no bars could hold them any longer in captivity. In the same  way, Jesus has already paid the ransom for our breakthroughs, deliverance and healing; and so nothing can hold us down anymore. This is why we can declare that no matter how long the affliction has lasted, according to the Word of God, the set time is now, because God will arise and have compassion on us. Rise up today and declare your freedom from affliction by reason of the ransom paid by Jesus. Your set time is now. Hallelujah!"

      "message": "The Presence of God; what a great promise by the Almighty God. The New Living Translation puts it in these words: “I will personally go with you, Moses, and I will give you rest—everything will be fine for you”(NLT). The benefits and blessings of the presence of God is uncountable. Understanding this should give us peace over every challenge that confronts us. |Let us consider a few of the benefits and blessings of that great gift of the presence of God: |(1) Satan is automatically put in his rightful place as far as we are concerned. Therefore we must not fall for the distractions of Satan. Rather, we must focus on the awesome presence  of God that Satan cannot contend with and so he can only scare but can no longer bite us. Remember Joshua, Caleb and the remaining 10 spies in Joshua 14:6-7. The 10 spies were scared but Joshua and Caleb were not because they understood the power of God's presence. |(2) Peace of mind; just as the Almighty God said to Moses that: “...and everything will be fine\" (NLT). Jesus Christ also declares: “I am leaving you with a gift—peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don't be troubled or afraid” John 14:27 NLT. Peace of mind is also guaranteed by the presence of God. We must not allow our minds to be troubled. Jesus knows that Satan will trouble our minds with unbelief, but we must not allow it. In the presence of God, there should be no unbelief because unbelief is not of God, and where God is, unbelief has to fail. James 1:6-7. In His presence is God Himself; and He cannot tell a lie. His Word says: “...everything will be fine for you” It just has to be fine. How it will be is not our concern, it is with Him, the Almighty. |(3) The presence of God gives us protection. David reveals this in Psalm 91:3 that: \"...He will rescue you from every trap...”. And in Psalm 136:24 that “...He freed us from our enemies...” because His love endures forever. Therefore, in the situation that we may find ourselves today, remember that because you are in Christ, you have the presence of God with you. No matter what the trap or snare of the enemy, His presence is bringing you out unscathed. With His presence, we can never be casualties because if He needs to destroy the agent that Satan is using to entrap us, God will do it. Hence the Psalmist in Psalm 136:17-21. Enjoy all the Benefits of the power of His presence today for your victory."

      "message": "When an ugly situations persist for too long, it is normal for humans in confusion, to look up and say “Lord I'm tired”. The confession of running out of energy, running out of solution to a problem that appears to be malignant can take the strength off any man. But the truth is, there is no problem that confronts us as children of God for which God does not have a solution. As it is commonly said that “What God cannot do does not exist”. And so, when a problem or issue persists, it's time to fervently call on the creator Himself for divine solution. |From the beginning of creation, every work of man was intended to be in partnership with God. The Almighty God knows that man by his effort will run out of energy, out of answers, out of resources and out of solution. This is not to say that God intentionally set man up to fail. No! Absolutely not! But, He set us up to learn to depend on Him and not on our strength for success. |In our text today, the word of God says: “Even youths will become weak and tired, and young men will fall in exhaustion. But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength...” Usually, when one is physically tired out of exhaustion from a busy day, the way to regain strength is to rest. God shows this by the fact that He also rested on the seventh day. But because God knows that we will get to the stage of emotional exhaustion, He says, “those who trust in the Lord will find new strength.” |Therefore when our situations get to the stage that we look up and about to throw our hands away in frustration and we look up in desperation, at that time, God says: “If you will just rest on Me”. Because the long standing situation is becoming a matter of the heart. But His Word has already gone ahead of such situations in Isaiah 26:3 that: “You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.” The Word of Christ also says: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\" (Matt 11:28-30 NIV) |Whatever may be your long standing problem or issue, whatever may be the challenge; however long it has been tormenting you; there is solution to it with God, if only you can just rest your heart on Him. He will renew your inner strength until the solution manifests. And, you can never be a casualty. He is a Master at fulfilling dreams. Relax your grip on the situation and let Him have the complete grip. You will be amazed at the result. Therefore, don't be tired."

      "message": "A popular Children's Sunday school choruses says \"Obedience is the very best way to show that you believe and doing exactly what the Lord commands.” The truth is that we all know that we must obey God, but somehow we still act in disobedience and unfortunately, we often land in trouble as a result of our disobedience. Now, we all need to ask why, after knowing what God wants us to do, we still act otherwise. Is it that we don't really understand the meaning of obedience or we forget how important it is to walk in obedience? Or do we need help on how to obey? These questions I believe every child of God need to ruminate over. |Obedience means exactly as the Sunday school song puts it - doing exactly what we are commanded to do. And, as Christians, obedience is the hallmark of our salvation. Although we are saved by grace through the redemptive work of Christ and His blood. It is our obedience that sets us apart as authentic children of God. When we obey God, we show Him that we love Him. And through our obedience we are enabled to enjoy God's love. But if we fail to obey God and we claim to be Christians, then we will be making God a liar to the unbelievers that will be judging the love of our God by what we go through. But when we walk in obedience, God reveals Himself to us, and it activates the power of God to work in our lives. And our lives become the testimony that draws others to Him. This is revealed in our text today as what Jesus requires of us. |Brethren, the world system is completely against God's word and standard. But we are not of this world, hence we must make a difference by our obedience. If we believe God and we love Him, then we must live in obedience to His word and commandments. As children of God who claim to love God, we must demonstrate that love by obeying His commands. God has to be able to truly count us as His Children through our obedience by aligning our daily lives and actions with His word as an act of our worship of Him. This is what brings blessings without any sorrow into our lives as revealed in Proverbs 10:22 that: “The blessing of the LORD makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it” (Proverbs 10:22). |Our obedience to God must also be revealed in our obedience to authority. Hence the Scripture says in Romans 13:1-2 that: “Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God [granted by His permission and sanction], and those which exist have been put in place by God. Therefore whoever resists [governmental] authority resists the ordinance of God. And those who have resisted it will bring judgment (civil penalty) on themselves” (AMP). Obedience to authority is therefore evidence of our obedience to God, so that as Jesus said to John the Baptist:  Paul says: “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness” (Matthew 3:15 NIV). Our obedience to God and authority is the fulfilment of righteousness. And by so doing, we also disarm the enemy. May we all walk in obedience in Jesus name."

      "message": "The above Text is a revelation that there are obstacles in life that keeps people from knowing God. These obstacles are not mere stones or rocks but dark powers working against the thoughts of our minds. Hence Apostle Paul says that whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, commendable, of excellence, and worthy of praise, are the things we should think about (Philippians 4:8). |Life generally is a battle, and if one is going to engage in wrestling, boxing, karate or judo, contest, there is no doubt that such persons will ensure that they are well prepared lest they go on a suicide mission. In the same manner, the battle of the mind is a serious battle and it is at this battle field (the mind) that proud obstacles raise themselves against the knowledge of God. When we do not have the knowledge of the power of God, we cannot trust Him. Just as if we don't know the strength of a man and he tells you, don't worry I'm right behind you, it will be difficult to trust such promises. But when you have the knowledge of that person's authority, might and power, there will be an unwavering confidence in you, borne out of firm trust in that authority. This is why the knowledge of God is very important in the life of every Christian. As such, Apostle Paul also wrote: “...that I might know Him and the Power of His Might...” Philippians 3:10. |In our text today, Apostle Paul tells us to destroy (Pull down strongholds) and in this context, he is talking about the wrong thoughts and perceptions in a man that contradicts the true knowledge of God and the nature of God. He, in effect, tells us to take hold of our thoughts because the mind is the battlefield where Satan engages to control our actions, and once a man is conquered in his mind, he will be conquered in the physical. Therefore, all our thoughts must be brought into obedience of Christ. When our minds are in obedience to Christ, we will truly be like Him. This is why the Book of Proverbs says: “As a man thinks in his heart, so he is” ( Proverbs 23:7). If the mind is not obedient to Christ, it becomes proudly, and the Bible says: “Haughty eyes, a proud heart, and evil actions are all sin.” (Proverbs 21:4 NLT). Also the Almighty God opposes the proud (James 4:6). In order for us to destroy every proud obstacle and capture rebellious thoughts, we must abide in Christ. For He alone overcame the world. Hence He says: “...For apart from me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5) |Our victory over every scheme of Satan comes when we have the knowledge of His word, and this can only be as we dig deeper into the scriptures. May we have the grace to capture every rebellious thought and thereby destroy every proud obstacle in our lives in Jesus name."

This simply means to transform our minds in such a way that we think the way Christ would think so that we can act the way Christ would act. |Brethren, to transform any aspect of ones life, particularly our attitude and mindset that develop because of what another person does to us can sometimes be like an overwhelming task. This is because we are all humans and with human nature. But since it is what Our Heavenly Father expects of us, them it becomes a task that must be accomplished. The saying goes that:  “How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.” The way to  change our mindset is only with the help of God but, we must also have a determination to have a change; and so, on our part it will be by “one thought at a time”. |Our thoughts set the direction of our lives. If we need to change the direction we are heading in or how we relate with a wicked or harsh boss, we simply need to change our thoughts in that area. God desires that we have good relationship with people and to have peace of mind at work. We may not please everyone, but we can strive to please God and this helps us in the way we relate with others with the mindset of Christ. |Therefore, when you are oppressed by a wicked or harsh boss and thought like “this wicked boss wants to kill me” comes to your mind, it is the “one thought” that must be taken captive at a time and instantly cast it out by not allowing it to linger further. Not giving it a chance. And immediately also,  replacing such thoughts with what God's Word says. |When one is labouring under an oppressive and harsh boss, the tendency is for one to get negative due to the feelings of frustration; and this may lead to all manner of negative thoughts coming to one's mind. Such negative thoughts can be replaced with what God says in the scriptures like: “...None will make me afraid...” (Leviticus 26:6). “I will lie down unafraid, and many will look to me for help. ..” (Job 11:19). Those many that will look to us for help will end up including even the oppressive boss by reason of the power of the word of God. Because God can allow the boss  to find himself in a situation that only people at your level can help. Just like the story of the lion, the rat. As big and ferocious the lion is. One day he found himself caged in a mesh net. As powerful as the lion is, it could not help himself. But the rat was close by, and the rat offered to help. The tiny teeth of the small tiny rat was what was all that the rat used to help in  freeing the lion. The word of God is that powerful to turn things around. |Brethren, evil abound in our world today and ungodly bosses have become more devious in their wickedness. Their wicked actions can also cause a person to have negative thoughts. But because we are children of God, we cannot allow their own wickedness to cause our thoughts to run afoul of what our Father expects of us. Therefore, we must encourage ourselves to be aggressive in taking captive all negative thoughts by the word of God. Having the mindset of Christ is also by the wisdom of God, as it pertains to dealing with wicked or harsh bosses. Therefore we must also pray for wisdom. It is one of the greatest things we need to pray for while working with harsh bosses. Wisdom is the main thing that Solomon prayed for right from the time He became the king. Solomon wanted to know how to rule wisely. So if we want to know how to handle or relate with ungodly harsh bosses; with the mindset of Christ in order to please and glorify God, then we need to ask Him for wisdom. May we all have God's wisdom and Christ's mindset in Jesus name."

Daniel 3:16-18 says: “Your threat means nothing to us. If you throw us in the fire, the God we serve can rescue us from your roaring furnace and anything else you might cook up, O king. But even if he doesn't, it wouldn't make a bit of difference, O king. We still wouldn't serve your gods or worship the gold statue you set up” Daniel 3:16-18 (MSG). |Today, we also have the story of Leah Shuaibu who was not released by Boko Haram because she would not deny the name of Jesus. That is the sharing in the sufferings of Christ. |In the little corner of our professions, occupations, vocations, callings, jobs, employments, careers and businesses, how much are we willing to share in the sufferings of Christ by refusing to conform with the world? |This was the desire of Apostle Paul who said of himself when he spoke about the real believers in Philippians 3:3-6. If we are more controlled by our impressive credentials and influences and would rather compromise Faith than loosing them, Apostle Paul then talks of his pedigree that: “though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more...” (vs.4). He goes on to say that he was circumcised on the eighth day, being an Israelite, that he is of the tribe of Benjamin, he is a Hebrew of Hebrews; and that when it comes to the law, he is a Pharisee. That he was so zealous about everything Jewish that he persecuted the church. And that when it comes to righteousness under the law, he was blameless. (Vs.5-6) |He concluded by saying in verses 7-8 that: “The very credentials these people are waving around as something special, I'm tearing up and throwing out with the trash, along with everything else I used to take credit for. And why? Because of Christ. Yes, all the things I once thought were so important are gone from my life. Compared to the high privilege of knowing Christ Jesus as my Master, firsthand, everything I once thought I had going for me is insignificant—dog dung. I've dumped it all in the trash so that I could embrace Christ and be embraced by him. (MSG) |That is the fellowship of His sufferings. Are we doing that as believers of today? I pray that we will truly be prepared to suffer for the sake of Him who suffered for us to be reconciled to God."

      "message": "Apostle Paul in his letter to the Philippian Christians made the above profound statement. Before Paul's conversion, he being a Jew, was a member of the Synagogue and as he speaks of his pedigree in Philippians 3:4-6, that he was a strict and devout adherent to God's law; a defender of the purity of the Jewish religion. And this he did with so much passion to the point of persecuting the followers of Christ because he believed that the Christians were not observers of everything set down in God's law. Also being a Pharisee, Paul was a very important member of the Synagogue. But when he got converted, he encountered a new life. |And so, in our main text today, Paul said his desire was to know Jesus. This should be the desire of every believer. A lot of us Christians are still in the category that Paul was before his conversion. We go to church regularly, we observe the 30 days victory month fasting and prayer year in year out. In fact, very many of us are ardent observers of the Ten Commandments; we are well respected leaders in the church. In some cases, church decisions will not be taken in the absence of some of us because of how much such people's opinions are respected. But for these people, all that they glory in is self righteousness. The Bible says that by strength shall no man prevail - 1 Samuel 2:19. The Bible says says it is not of works lest any man should boast - Ephesians 2:9 |To know Christ is not the same as knowing His historical life; it is not the same as knowing the correct doctrines regarding Jesus; it is not the same as knowing His moral exemplary life, and it is not the same as knowing His great work on our behalf. It is just as the Psalmist made a distinction between Moses' relationship with God and that of the children of Israel with God in Psalm 103:7 that God made His ways known to Moses, but His works (miracles) to the people of Israel. So to know Jesus takes more than just to know the miracles he performed. This was the desire of Paul and should be the same for us as believers. |Take for example, we can say that we know someone because we recognise him\/her; because we can distinguish what is different about that person compared to other people. We can also say that we know someone because we are acquainted with what he does; ( like how the Israelites knew God). And just like we know the shoe cobbler because we take our shoes to him to mend etc. |But beyond all these, there is a way of that we know Jesus Christ which also includes all of the other ways that we know people and also goes beyond those knowings. The way of knowing for every believer includes who Jesus is to you personally. Charles Spurgeon, the powerful Baptist preacher says of how he knows Christ when he wrote as follows: “They tell me he is a refiner, that he cleanses from spots; he has washed me in his precious blood, and to that extent I know him. They tell me that he clothes the naked; he hath covered me with a garment of righteousness, and to that extent I know him. They tell me that he is a breaker, and that he breaks fetters, he has set my soul at liberty, and therefore I know him. They tell me that he is a king and that he reigns over sin; he hath subdued my enemies beneath his feet, and I know him in that character. They tell me he is a shepherd: I know him for I am his sheep. They say he is a door: I have entered in through him, and I know him as a door. They say he is food: my spirit feeds on him as on the bread of heaven, and, therefore, I know him as such.” |The Founder of Methodist Church had been a minister for some years, but there came a day in his life that he had a different encounter and while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, he said: “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\" |Brethren, the question for us today is “Do we know Him?” Apostle Paul not only desired to know Jesus but also to know the power of His resurrection. To  Know Jesus means knowing this power, i.e. the new life that is imparted to us now, not when we die. We also need to know in an experiential way the power of Christ's resurrection. To experience the same power that raised Christ from the dead in every situation of our lives as well. The power of His resurrection is an evidential power. It is the evidence and seal that everything Jesus did and said was true.The power of His resurrection is a justifying power. It is the receipt and proof that the sacrifice of the cross was accepted as payment in full. The power of His resurrection is a life-giving power which means that the believer who is connected with Jesus Christ receives the same resurrected life. The power of His resurrection is a consoling and comforting power. This is knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection. As believers, I pray that we will truly know Him."

      "bibleRef": "“Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades” (John 5:2 NIV).",
      "message": "Situations or occasions do happen in the life of a man when there will be no help from fellow men either because they have become tired of helping the man or the situation is beyond human help. |In Psalm 27:10 king David said: \"When my father and mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up.\" This simply proves that father and mother may even forsake one. |There are also situations where those that man has trusted to help or that have even promised to help have failed. This is also written by Prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 49:15-16 where God asked a question, \"Is it possible for a woman to forget a sucking child? That she should not have compassion upon the child of her womb? And God answered and said, “Yes, she may forget.” Therefore people that even want to help one may forget or fail. |The third situation is when it is beyond the ability of man to help as written in Isaiah 43:2 that: Almighty God says \"when you are passing through the rivers I will be with you, when you are passing through the water it won't overflow you. He said even when you are passing through fire; the fire will not burn you because I will be there by your side.\" It is a fact of life that no friend will open his\/her eyes and with his\/her right senses enter into fire with another friend, and so in such situations, nobody wants to help. |The conclusion of the matter is that everyone, at some point in their lives would need divine intervention; and I pray that whatever may be our situation or circumstances today, God will intervene for us in Jesus name. |The text of today taken from the story in the Book of John 5:1-15, about the man at the pool of Bethesda, needing healing in the pool. But there was no one to help him get into the pool as everyone was there for their own miracles too. However, when Jesus appeared, it was a divine intervention and his story changed. |Also, in Luke 18:27 Jesus says that those things that are impossible with men are possible with God. Also in Luke 1:37 the Bible says that, with God all things are possible. Therefore, no matter what your situation may be, and no matter how long you have been in it, just like the man in the main text of today that has been at the pool for 38 years, there will be divine intervention for you in Jesus name because God in fact says in Jeremiah 32:17 that: \"Behold, I am the God of all flesh, is there anything too hard for me?\" All that you need to do is to answer the question and say over your situation that: No! Nothing! And so the situation is not hard for God to change. |The areas that we may need divine intervention are: Our physical lives, our financial lives, and even our marital lives. The man at the pool of Bethesda in John 5:2-9, was in need of divine intervention for his physical life that had remained unchanged and without help for 38 yeas. There was no man ready to help him, but Jesus Christ, the helper of the helpless appeared in his situation. I pray that today, Jesus will divinely meet you at the points of your needs. All you need to do is call on Him and trust Him. |In Matthew 17:14-18 when the disciples failed to help the man that brought his son to them for healing, Jesus did what the disciples were unable to do. In every way that man has failed, that even pastors have failed to help, God will divinely intervene on your behalf in Jesus name. |There can also be need for financial help but no one is helping. This was what happened in the life of the widow in 2 Kings 4:1-7. She was the wife of a Prophet who had died, and so, she inherited her husband's debt, her two sons were going to be taken from her and sold in order to pay the debt. There was no one to help her. All the people around her had empty vessels which shows that even if they wanted to help they had no means. She ran to Elisha who in fact asked her \"what do you want me to do?\" (2 kings 4:2). But God divinely intervened. Is your situation  such that the people you are running to asking out the same question? God is saying to you today was that He will divinely intervene. |In our marital lives, God can divinely intervene in that situation that has lasted so long and you are almost giving up. The story of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1:4-20 shows that she had a husband that loved her, but yet could not help her in her situation of childlessness. There is no doubt that her husband would have done all that he could because of his love for her, but human efforts failed Hannah. The fact that Peninnah (the second wife) had children is proof that  Hannah's inability to have children was not the fault of the husband. But when Hannah cried to God, there was divine intervention. Whatever may be the challenge in your marriage, the God that has solution to all problems of life will divinely intervene for you in Jesus name.   |Divine intervention is God in Himself bringing solution to the problems of man be it physical, financial or even marital; that has defied all human solution, or that no one wants to help with, or that the help of man has failed. Today, I pray that divine intervention will appear for you no matter the situation or how long it has been and your testings will suddenly become big testimonies in Jesus name."

      "message": "The Bible says God makes everything beautiful in its own time. Therefore this last season of the year comprising of September, October, November and December called the Ember months are of its own time. God says in Isaiah 41:10 that “Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God...”. Also Jesus Christ says in Matthew 28:20 that behold I am with you always, therefore as children of God we are not alone as we journey to the end of this year and into the next glorious year. All we need to do is to plan with God because He already has us in mind and has already planned for our protection hence He says He will watch over our coming and going both now and forevermore” (Psalms 121:8). |Therefore, no matter the insecurity in the land, because you are secured in Him, you are protected. Keep dwelling in His presence and there will be no fear of the terror of the night, nor any arrow of kidnappers that flies by day. Because God had already given His Angels charge to watch over us. He also says He will satisfy us with long life and show us His salvation (Psalms 91:1-16). Therefore plan every journey and every step and take action with God. Also, no matter how tough or hard the situation around us may be, we must believe that since God is with us, things are not just going to be good for us but will get better and best for us in Jesus name. Let us keep seeking Him and continue to declare to ourselves by faith every day that this will be my best season of the year. |I pray that the angels of God assigned for our protection shall arise and defend us every day, guide us in all our ways, and bring us to the place of breakthrough, continued rest, and peace in Jesus name. We will never be involved in any form of accident, nor be victims of any kidnapping or assault by any demonic agents of darkness in Jesus name. There is no obstacle of failure for us and all our loved ones in Jesus name. |It is written, “From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. (Galatians 6:17). Because the seal of Jesus is on us, no agent of the wicked one in the form of man or woman will be able to touch us or cause us any trouble. |Just as the Bible says in Acts 27:22, that: “there will be no loss of life among you...”, I decree that no loss of any kind, be it material, physical or spiritual is permitted in any of our families in Jesus name. Because God's word says in 1 Kings 2:3 that, \"and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules...that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn...” That will be our portion in this season. Because we will plan with God, whatever we put our hands to do in this season shall prosper much more than ever before and yield abundant profits in Jesus name. The only things permitted to follow us this season are goodness and mercy, because God's Word says so. Therefore, we are disconnected from every evil network that says otherwise. As His word says: “surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever and ever, in Jesus name”(Psalm 23:6)."

      "message": "Dictionary defines an Epistle as “a poem or other literary work in the form of a letter or series of letters”. Therefore, all the Epistles of the Apostle are letters which today we read to teach us the truth, to rebuke us when we are wrong, to correct our faults, and to give us instructions for right ways of living. (2 Timothy 3:16). |The bible in several ways in the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ has compared those who follow Him including today's believers to many things. E.g. Jesus compared us to branches when He says in John 15:5 that: “I am the true vine, ye are the “branches”.  He also compared us to salt that: “Ye are the salt of the earth.” - Matthew 5:13. Jesus also compared us to light and said: “Ye are the light of the world.” - (Matthew 5:14). Jesus also compared us to sheep when He says “My sheep know my voice and a stranger will they not hear” in John 10:27. |In our text today, Apostle Paul also compared us to Epistles i.e. letters. As stated earlier, an epistle as defined by the dictionary is a letter. Therefore, as a believer, you are a Letter and I am also a letter, written with the spirit of the living God. |Every letter carries a message or some messages. Some letters are friendly, some are just letters to say “thank you”; other letters carry message of congratulations; some are letters of sympathy, some are love letters and and some are not good letters e.g. a sack letter or warning letters. |So, there are many kinds of letters. But as believers, we are meant to be the living letters of Jesus Christ, carrying messages of good tidings of great joy unto this dying world. |In our text, Apostle Paul said that the Corinthians are the letters that they have written on the heart of mean. In other words, other people who were not followers of Christ are going to read the lives of the Corinthian Christians and whatever they read is what will draw them to the God that these Christians worshipped or push them away from God. |The same principle still applies in our world of today. People are no longer reading their Bibles. But you as a Christian is the Bible that all the people around you will read; whether you relate with them or not. They will read your behaviours and attitudes, your faith or lack of it, and take a decision to come to Christ or not. |Every believer therefore needs to ask  himself\/herself “what attitudes or behaviours am I exhibiting that is hindering the delivery of the message of Christ. Attitudes of selfishness, attitudes of non-commitment, attitudes of pride,  attitudes of I don't like the way he spoke to me; attitudes of I don't like the way she looked at me etc.  Unfortunately it is our attitude that determines our altitude. In other words, how high we can go in Christ depends on each person's attitude towards Christ. If you have a low attitude you will have a low altitude. And so, your attitude or behaviour towards others also determine how many you are able to draw to Christ or push away from Christ. |The Bible shows in several ways how God calls us to live a life of holiness; as we see in Romans 12:1, “Present your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.” Ephesians 1:4 “We should be Holy and without Blame”. 1 Peter 2:5 “Be ye holy for I am holy”. All these are not only for our own sake but for the sake of those who will only read you and I and take a decision to do or not to do something. And if they read the wrong thing and take the wrong step, they may never have another opportunity to change their ways. If that happens, the Word of God says, it such a Christian that has caused those ones to fall. Jesus also reveals that: “It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.” (Luke 17:2). May that not be our portion in Jesus name. |Today, the Word has come to us to check our ways and ensure that in our behaviours and attitudes we are not sending people away from God Almighty because we are the Epistle that they are reading daily."

In the Scriptures, we have examples of what it means to “trust in the Lord with all your heart”. These include what Noah did, building a great big boat in the middle of dry land when there was no cloud in the sky. And despite all the ridicules of his neighbours, Noah continued in building the Ark just because God said so. Abraham also packed up everything he had, left his home land at the age of 75 because God told him to do so. In the New Testament, Apostle Peter stepped out of the boat to walk towards Jesus and walked on the water, because Jesus told him to do so also is proof of trusting in the Lord and not leaning on our own understanding. |When an ordinary Christian declared that “Jesus is Lord” in a Roman Empire which only recognized one Lord whose name was Caesar; is proof of the trust of the Christian in the Lordship of and faith in Jesus. |Trusting in the Lord means Faith in Him. And this will sometimes mean going out on one limb for God. The Psalmist also says in Psalm 37:3-5 that: “Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will act:” The proof that we are trusting in God to act is that, if He doesn't act, we will fall flat on our faces. |What have you done in the last week, or last month, or last year, which has depended for success or failure on the intervention of Almighty God? What have you done where the outcome would have been different depending on whether God actually existed or not? In fact most of the time we don't  rely on God for what we do. We rely on our human understanding. We rely on our natural abilities and our skills and all our experience. We rely on our bank accounts which we believe are always there to fall back on if things don't go as well as we planned. |But the Prophet said in Jeremiah 9: 23-24 that: “This is what the LORD says: “Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, |for in these I delight,” |We are trusting God with all our hearts when the only thing we have to boast about is not our wisdom or our strength or our riches, but simply that we know God and He knows us and cares for us. When we are delighting ourselves in the Lord, we receive the desires of our hearts. |Sometimes we spend lots and lots of time and energy and thinking, trying to work out what we should be doing in our own lives and in the lives of our loved ones. In our relationships, or careers, or hobbies, or family life. We think about what we want and how we should get it. But, in all these areas of life, we need to learn how to trust God and let Him guide us. We also need to learn how not to lean on our own understanding. |Brethren, even when facing challenges or oppositions, your opponent may be relying on some economic influence they believe that they have; or even at worse still, they may trust in some marine powers, witchcraft powers or other demonic powers. They may also rely on the power of their wealth and connection to men of authority and power. But all these will fail when God rises up in your defence because you are trusting in Him and Him alone. Therefore, brethren, whatever may be your challenge today, trust in the Lord."

So that we can be prosperous and have good success. |Our Lord Jesus Christ capped it up by saying in John 14:15 that: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” Keeping His commandments simply means obedience to His word. |Do you desire a new thing in your life, your finances and even in your children in this month of new neginning? The key is to show God that you love Him by obeying His words in every area of your life. God will do that new thing in your life because God does new things for those that love Him."

      "bibleRef": "“But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God” (Acts 20:24 NKJV).",
      "message": "It is quite interesting that Apostle Paul in all his travails, persecutions and negative reactions from people he preached to, did not concentrate so much on these challenges than he did on his prayer that God would give him the strength to go through each challenge with a good attitude. Apostle Paul sought emotional maturity. Emotional maturity is what every believer needs to pray to have. This is because, the time of challenge is the time that our level of emotional maturity will be made obvious. In other words, it is a period that how much it takes for one to get us upset will be visible. The wise King Solomon says: “If you are weak in a crisis, you are weak indeed” (Proverbs 24:10). |What is emotional level? Emotion is simply one's feelings. It includes happiness, love, fear, anger, or hatred. And, emotional level simply is how long it takes for anyone's character or behaviour  to be excessively affected by their feelings, particularly negative feelings. An adage goes that “A small pot boils the quickest.” Application of this will mean that if one does not get their emotional levels to that of Christ, one will always get stressed up at the slightest challenge and we will find ourselves making negative utterances and confessions and thereby making a mountain out of molehills. |Parents usually loose their cool because their child or ward failed to do something right. Some people get aggravated because somebody didn't do something they wanted them to do. And because of another man's failure, they loose their own peace. When we keep doing all these as Christians, then we may not be passing the test of faith through challenges. |Though as humans, we would tend not to be able to keep calm when people do things so awkwardly or irritatingly wrong. However, as Christians, we are not to allow our emotions to rule over us. This is why the Bible says that we should not worry about anything...(Philippians 4:6-7). There's need for us to grow and mature to the point that we can say, like Apostle Paul said that: “None of these things move me.” Apostle Paul in effect said: “Because I trust God, it is no big deal. I will not worry about this because Jesus pointed out series of things for which He says we should : “Worry Not...” (Matthew 6:25-34). We all have a destinies to fulfil than to worry about what other people do or do not do to the extent of us getting us stressed out. |People will certainly do things wrong. Your children will do things you don't expect them to do, just as we also sometime get things wrong with God. Therefore, let us choose to begin to see things from God's perspective, and ask for grace to be calm rather than get emotionally stressed. We must learn not to focus on other people's flaws so that they do not get us stressed. People's attitudes can really be irritating, particularly when we believe that they ought to know how to do it right. But if we look at such issues from the way we also do things that God's Word says do not do, e.g. anger, resentment etc., but the Almighty God rather than throw us away, helps us to have a positive turn around and do the right thing, we also must give the people in our lives the chance to make amends, rather than getting so angered and resentful. We are to be Christlike. |As believers, when we dwell so much on the faults of others, and get emotionally stressed up, we are really forgetting the work of the gospel in us. Apostle Paul said to the Christians in Corinth that: “Who made you superior to others?...” (1 Corinthians 4:7a GNBUK). The Holy Spirit will help us all to get to the level that Jesus set for us in Jesus name. By His mercy and power, our emotions will not get us to negative turns because of another person's flaws, wrongs or shenanigans in Jesus name. Amen."

      "bibleRef": "“The LORD will accomplish that which concerns me; Your [unwavering] lovingkindness, O LORD, endures forever. Do not abandon the works of Your own hands.” (Psalm 138:8 AMP)",
      "message": "To “accomplish” means to “achieve or complete successfully”. It also means “to finish something successfully”. The ESV Bible version of today's Text says: “God will fulfil His plan.” Simply put: That which God has in plan for you will be perfected by Him; it will be total, thorough and real. Amen |In the preceding verse of today's text, (verse 7), we can see why the Psalmist made the confession that “God will accomplish what concerns him”. And the reason is that he recognises that in life there are troubles and daily we walk in the midst of trouble. Trouble is not the friend of any man, trouble can bring the life of a man to a halt or a total end. And so the Psalmist says that even though he “walks in the midst of trouble”, God will revive him. God will stretch out His hand against the wrath of the enemies, and God's right hand will save him. This shall be your portion in Jesus name. Amen |Brethren, it is a fact of life that man daily walks in midst of trouble. It is also a fact of life that there is the wrath of the enemy in operation. Man's enemy being Satan. And this is why calamities do happen to people. But no calamity will come to us because God will perfect that which concerns us in Jesus name. Trouble means distressing or dangerous situation, and this can come to man as consequences of man's own disobedience. Saul the king is a typical example. He was chosen by God, but his disobedience to God's specific instruction led him into trouble; and this caused him his throne as king and also his life (1 Samuel Chapter 9 and chapter 15). Trouble can also come to man through the wrath of the enemy. This is the kind of trouble that comes by satanic wickedness which is borne out of envy. Trouble can also come through schemes of the enemy (Matthew 13:25). And it can also come when as children of God, we fail to apply knowledge and operate with wisdom. (Hosea 4:6). |But, Psalm 138 is another promise of God to deliver; so that whether you are in trouble due to your own wrong doing, fault, mistake or disobedience like king Saul; or you are in trouble from the trap of the enemy; or probably just due to the wrath of the enemy borne out of envy or wicked anger; by reason of the covenant of the Blood of Jesus, God will revive you in Jesus name. God will stretch out His hand against the enemies and He will save you with His right hand. And, His perfection shall come into your life. |Brethren, perfection is the original plan of God for man, and He will work out that perfection in your life and in your family and in the lives of your loved ones  in Jesus name. Every trouble comes to man because the life of man was corrupted by Satan. Thereby man keeps facing troubles, trials, tribulations, lack, limitations, dejection, rejection and diverse negative things. But no matter what the corruption is, God remains God if only we will turn to Him and call on Him. He says in Malachi 3:6 that |\"I am the LORD, and I do not change. That is why you descendants of Jacob are not already destroyed.\" Just run to God and your situation will receive Divine touch. |The popular Hymn “What a Friend We Have In Jesus” says in its 3rd stanza thus: |“Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord in prayer.” We only need to  take it to Him and trust Him. This is why Apostle Paul also writes that: \"Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.\" Romans 10:11. By God's mercy, you will not be put to shame, and your testimony shall be great because God Almighty in His word has promised to perfect all that concerns you; and He will surely do as His word says."

      "bibleRef": "“...I will have mercy on anyone I wish; I will take pity on anyone I wish.” So then, everything depends, not on what human beings want or do, but only on God's mercy.” (Romans 9:15-16 GNT)",
      "message": "The final plea that a lawyer makes before the Court when a defendant is convicted is usually to ask the Judge or Magistrae to “Temper Justice with Mercy”. In other words, to allow mercy to step down the weight of punishment. Often times it works. And, that is human court. |With the Court of God, mercy can remove even capital punishment of the dark world because God has already placed our punishment on His Son; Jesus Christ. Hence the word says, there is therefore no condemnation to them who are in Christ (Romans 8:1) |The Bible describes the mercy of God in the following five (5) ways: |1.  God's mercy is GREAT- (Isaiah 54:7). It speaks over every evil judgment and nothing can counter balance it. |2.  The mercies of God are SURE. You can depend on it, it is an everlasting covenant sealed with the Blood of Jesus (Isaiah 55:3). |3.  The mercy of God is ABUNDANT. (1 Peter 1:3), Apostle Peter says: God brought us into a live of hope by His abundant mercy through Jesus' resurrection. |4.  The mercies of God is TENDER (Psalm 25:6). The Psalmist says the tender mercy of God has been of old. |5.  The mercies of God are NEW every morning (Lamentation 3:22-23). Therefore, God's mercy can never be exhausted. As the day breaks there is a new level of God's mercy. It does not ever fail. Without the mercy of God, man's destiny will be completely messed up by the enemy. It was mercy that spoke for Lot, mercy spoke for Joseph, mercy spoke for David, mercy spoke for Apostle Paul, despite all that he did as Saul. Today, no matter what you are facing or have to face, mercy will speak for you in Jesus name.   |The only thing that gives meaning to life is the mercy of God. It is Divine. It is not dependent on man's will or effort. It is not dependent on man's qualification or otherwise. It does not depend on man's connection or lack of it. Mercy is God Himself in action. Therefore when mercy speaks, protocols are set aside. Mercy is simply, Divine Partiality. In Luke 18:35-43, the Bible speaks of a blind beggar at Jericho, and how he received his sight. The blind beggar was always sitting by the roadside begging. But one faithful day, although he could not see, but he heard movements of a crowd and he asked what was happening. Then someone told him that \"Jesus of Nazareth is passing by\" (Vs.37). The Bible says that immediately, the man cried out, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" (Vs.38). Although other people tried to shut him up, but He cried louder that: \"Son of David, have mercy on me”. That cry for mercy made Jesus to stop. And that day, the blind man received His sight. |Today, no matter how terrible your situation may be. You only need to shout to God for mercy. Also, no matter how simple or easy you think your own situation is, you still need to ask for mercy over the schemes of man. Remember that the enemy always tries to turn tables the negative way; and he just needs one man to yield to his evil suggestions. But if you can cry to God for mercy; the mercy of God will speak for you to rubbish every scheme of the enemy. As the Word of God says, nothing  in life is dependent on man's effort or desire. It all depends on mercy. I pray that mercy will speak for you and speak for your children and loved ones in Jesus name. Amen."

      "message": "Probably you have been praying continuously and fervently over a particular situation or an issue in your life, and it appears like answers are not coming or as though God is not hearing you at all. Probably you have even claimed and confessed series of promises of God in the scriptures, but the situation remains unyielding and not willing to abate. Brethren, do do not despair. Our text today says: “Your crops will be so plentiful that you will still be harvesting corn when it is time to pick grapes, and you will still be picking grapes when it is time to sow corn. You will have all that you want to eat, and you will live in safety in your land” |Your threshing season is your prayer season. And according to the Word, your harvest is going to overlap with grape harvest. If you can just believe God's Word, He is going to accelerate His work in your life. And what seems to have taken days, weeks, months or even years, will be done for you in a moment. This means that, in a moment, your breakthrough will come forth; in an instant you will be promoted to your long deserved level; in an instant the miraculous conception will happen; in an instant there will be a divinely opened door of opportunities that will make your financial struggles a thing of the past; in an instant your child or ward will receive divine healing that only God will take the Glory. In an instant, the prodigal child will receive the mind of Christ and change for God's glory. And while you are still rejoicing over one miracle, another one will be announced for you. Then, the word fullness of joy will, in an instant be you lot. And suddenly, your nickname will be JUDAH. Then, people will begin to seek after your God. So shall it be for you and I, in Jesus name. |God is about to God take us further than we ever thought possible and faster than we ever thought possible. He has in His hands our times and season for glorious things to begin to fall head over heels for us by His own design. God is without any shadow of doubt working behind the scenes on our behalf and in our favour. Just as His Word has said, by Mercy, God will accelerate your season and thrust upon your life immeasurable blessings that He had prepared for you from when He created you in Jesus name. |Brethren, when God issues the order for your season of manifestation of all your long awaited blessings and miracles, even the devil will have no option but to bow in obedience to God's order issued on your behalf. Remember that Haman had to announce the lifting of Mordecai (Esther 6:6-14). That is how God glorifies His name in the lives of His children. And, It would not matter what is happening in Your locality, community or even nation. Remember also the biblical history of Isaac in the time of famine. There was terrible famine in the land, but in that same year, the Bible says that “Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the Lord blessed him” (Genesis 26:1, 12). |God is not controlled by anything or anyone but He is in control of all things and everyone. And if He says to you that your crops will be so plentiful that “you will still be harvesting corn when it is time to pick grapes, and you will still be picking grapes when it will be time to sow corn. You will have all that you want to eat, and you will live in safety in your land”; you only have to believe Him and live right. His promises never fail. Your season of reaping is now. Hallelujah!"

      "message": "Let us assume that an athlete was told convincingly that he\/she had already won the race even before the race was started? How would that affect the athlete's performance at the contest? I believe he\/she would run the hardest to ensure that the victory a becomes reality. This is can be likened to what is called catch-22. (Catch-22 is a paradoxical situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules or limitations). Examples are things like “I couldn't start my own business until I have got money and I couldn't get the money until I start my own business.”  In other words, you know that once you start your business, you will have  money; but you must have money to start the business. Also, like an establishment or corporate body will say you need experience to get a job with them; but you also have to work to get the experience. In other words, no matter how solid your ultimate victory is, you still have to do what is necessary to get it. This is often seen as weird, but that is what Jesus' situation was like. He is God, He knew He was going to win, yet He had to play a certain way and do it perfectly in order to have the victory. And as we read in the book of Ephesians that being in Christ we have the victory, and it is the only way that there can be victory for humanity. |The one that is in Christ is already predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will. Being in Christ, we are given the Holy Spirit, the guarantee or down payment of this inheritance until we possess it. In other words, with the power of the Holy Spirit, we have victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, but we have to play by the rules. In other words, we must live our lives on God's principles. These principles are not just thou shall not steal, thou shall not lie; the principles are the embodiment of Christ in us and how it is exhibited in our relationship with Christ, in the things we do (i.e. our deeds, words or action) and also in our inactions. |Paul therefore says: \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things\" (Philippians 4:8). |Are there things that we find ourselves doing that are contrary to the victory that we already have in Christ? We need to recognize what those things are, and drop them. |This is the Catch-22 of the believer's life. We have victory through Jesus no doubt, but we must play by the rules so that we can live in that victory. I pray that our lives will manifest our victory in Him, so that we do not become sign posts that lead people in the right direction, but itself not heading to any destination. Amen.

      "message": "The Bible is replete with the diverse promises of God and its coming to pass in the lives of the children of God. One of such examples is what today's text revealed - Jehoshaphat and his troop went back to Jerusalem triumphantly because God defeated their enemies. God will always give victory to His Children. However, victories from God are also, always the result of God's children obeying His Word. The story behind today's text is that God gave specific instructions to Israel and Judah for the battle. The instruction was that they would not have to fight the battle. They were just to take up their positions and wait...(vs.17). And while the people were still and waiting to hear from God, King Jehoshaphat bowed to worship God. All the people also bowed with him and they worshipped God. While they worshipped, the Levites (the male Jews who assist the Priests in worship in the Jewish temple) all stood up and with a loud shout, they praised the Lord God of Israel. (Vs.18-19). |It should be noted that it was in their being still before God that they could truly worship God, while the king appointed some of them to march ahead of the army, singing the praise of God and saying: \"Give thanks to the LORD, for his steadfast love endures forever\".  This was a strange way to fight a battle. But the truth of the victory of the children of God lies in the praise of their God. There is power in praise. The Scripture says: “And when they began to sing and praise, the LORD set an ambushment against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah, so that they were routed (confused).\" (vs.22). |My brothers and sisters, when God fights your battle, your enemy will be confused. In the confusion of the three enemies of the Israelites, they waged war against themselves. The men of Ammon and Moab first rose against the people of Mount Seir, ravaged them to destruction. Thereafter; when they had killed all the people of of Seir, they now helped to destroy one another. In other words, after Ammon and Moabites had killed the people of Seir, they faced each other and now killed one another. (Vs.23). |As you wait on God and trust Him in this season of fasting and prayer; by His Might, every enemy of your life, your progress, your breakthrough and the enemy of the progress of your spouse and children will all help to destroy themselves in Jesus name. The Almighty God is the One that will fight your battle; and the only thing that you will need to do is to worship and praise Him. |Coming back to Jehoshaphat, the Bible reveals that in the end, God did for the children of Israel what He had promised. That is: fight for them without their having to lift a finger in the battle. And God was praised. All the kingdoms of the earth knew that God is the one who delivers. By the same token, I pray for you that, no matter what your trials and challenges may be, no matter how fierce the battle is, as you remain still, listening for God's instruction, obeying and trusting Him, your victory is sure. |Brethren, I encourage you today to trust God. No matter the threats of the enemy over your life, family, clan, tribe, or race, the promise of God is that He will deliver you, He will not allow any evil or the enemy to overcome you because nothing can overcome God. God has specific instructions for each  battle as can be seen in the scriptures. All you need to do is to listen to God. The same God that spoke to the generation of the children of Israel coming out of Egypt in Exodus 14:13, has not changed and can never change. He is the same God that said to another generation of the same Israelites in 2 Chronicles 20:15 i.e. “Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD”. |Brethren, God has the track record of deliverance for all His children that will trust Him. He has never disappointed anyone and you cannot be the first for Him to disappoint. But you have the part of trust to play all through your challenges, your trials, and even the the chaotic insecurity of this time. No matter what you hear people say; no matter what the world is screaming, all you need to do is to trust the word of God. Trust His promises as written in Psalm 46:1-3, 10-11; Psalm 91:7-10, 14 and many more. You are a victor and not a victim if you can listen to Him, trust and praise Him. |Brethren, you have learnt from Jehoshaphat. The scripture says that whatever was written in former days happened to them as an example, but were written for our instruction, that by endurance and encouragement through the Scriptures we also might have hope. (See Romans 15:4 and 1 Corinthians 10:6, 11). Therefore, \"Fear not, I am the one who helps you.\" (Isaiah 41:13) says the Lord. You will defeat every enemy of your peace and existence, and God will give you victory in Jesus name. Amen."

      "message": "Everything that a man does daily is a seed being planted. There will always be the time of harvest. It is not just a natural law of sowing and reaping but the commandment of God that: “While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest...shall not cease.\" (Genesis 8:22). That being the case, the word of God also says: “A man shall eat well by the fruit of his mouth..” (Proverbs 13:2 NKJV). Fruits are by products of seed; therefore every word spoken is a seed. A typical example comes from the children of Israel when they were to go and possess the land of Canaan. The Bible recorded that twelve spies were sent to survey the land, out of which ten of them gave negative reports. But Joshua and Caleb gave a report based on their faith and trust in God.( Numbers 13:25-33). The negative reports led to the children of Israel grumbling against Moses and Aron and said: “...It would have been better to die in Egypt or even here in the wilderness; Why is the LORD taking us into that land? We will be killed in battle, and our wives and children will be captured. Wouldn't it be better to go back to Egypt?” So they said to one another, “Let's choose a leader and go back to Egypt”(Numbers 14:2-4 GNB). |These were people who saw the miraculous deliverance of God at the Red Sea, yet because of the negative reports of the ten spies, their brains suddenly became dementia with no memory of how God had delivered them by His power; nor any memory of the power of God to deliver at all times. God therefore responded to them in Numbers 14:28 that: “As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say” (Numbers 14:28 NIV). |Brethren, our words are not just powerful and creative, but they are seeds. And when a seed is planted, there will be harvest some day. Today, there have been a lot of negatives going on around us. The question for us as believers is: What are we uttering from our mouths? Apostle Paul in his letter to the Galatians quoted in the main text of today started his sentence by the warning “Do not be deceived...a man reaps what he sows”. The wise king Solomon also says in proverbs 13:2 that man will eat the fruit of his mouth. Therefore, we must not think that we can just say anything and it won't have any effect. Whether you are a believer or not, every man reaps the fruits of what he says. |Brethren, what are you saying about your challenges? Be it personal, family, communal, national or the challenge of a race?  What is your confession? The children of Israel had a challenge caused by what the ten of the twelve spies said. The negative reports of the ten spies led to the negative murmuring of the children of Israel; and the result of God hearing what they said. My Brethren, what is God hearing you say over your present situation? |Every time we speak, seeds are sown and must be harvested at some point. Therefore, in this season, what we, our family, or race are going through; our words must be what we truly desire. Let us constantly evaluate our words to make sure we are depositing good seeds into the soil of our lives and the lives of others, so that we can reap good harvests in the future. |Remember what Jesus Christ said in John 6:63b that: “...the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.” Our words can also produce life not death because we are Christ's and so must align our words with the Word of God no matter how bad, frightening, ugly or messy the situation may seem to be. |Therefore, I charge us to deliberately plant the word of God in the soil of your life and the lives of your loved ones and your community. The good harvest shall be bountiful in Jesus name. Remember the words of the wise king Solomon in Proverbs 18:21 that death and life lies in the power of the tongue. Therefore, choose not to deceive yourself, rather choose to sow good seeds through your word and reap good harvest."

The synonyms of the word mercy also include leniency, clemency, compassion, grace, pity, charity, forgiveness, etc. I also found another definition of mercy which is: “Divine Partiality”. Partiality in itself means unfair bias in favour of one person or thing; it also means favouritism. |Going by the definition of partiality, mercy therefore means Almighty God, i.e. “Divinity” deciding to break every protocol or rule because of one person for a group of people. There are numerous examples of such in the Bible. |Apostle Paul referring to what God said to Moses, wrote in Romans 9:15 that: God says to Moses, \"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.\" This shows that Mercy of God does not require any qualification, it is not based on ones rights or any goodness of anyone. In fact, the Bible says no one is good except God. So, there is no good in any man to qualify him for mercy, but just divinity deciding to be partial towards one. |When mercy is at work for someone, it wont matter whether he\/she is the last to arrive, such a persons will just somehow be the first to be considered. |When we look at mercy in terms of divine favouritism, human laws are overruled for the person for whom mercy operates. Mercy also operates as divine acceptance, so that the one operating under mercy will be the only one acceptable no matter the level of human rejection. When divine favouritism is in operation even when the one upon whom mercy operates has been ruled out and deleted from a list, divine mercy will suddenly appear and put the person's name on the list and right at the top. |When Mercy operates by way of divine interest, everybody will be interested in the person's favour without explanation. When mercy shows up as unusual intervention; even when such a person's case or matter has been decided and judgement sealed, something beyond man's control will happen and such a person will walk home free, come out justified and in fact be celebrated; and every other human schisms will be overtaken by divine intervention. |When mercy operates, somehow the one that is qualified by man's ratings is removed for the one that man has adjudged unqualified. We can see examples of this in the life of Esther who by every human law and standard did not qualify to be in the palace; but even if somehow she found herself there, her position would have already been determined by her status; because she was one of the captive Jews and so would have just been a slave girl there. |But because divine mercy was in operation for Esther, Vashti the Queen misbehaved and was removed to be replaced by Esther, and she occupied the Palace as a Queen (Esther 2:15-17). |Brethren, have others gone ahead of you? There is no need for you as a child of God, bought with the precious blood of Jesus to fret because mercy is going to speak for you and you will be singled out before you know it. |By the time Esther appeared before the King, divine mercy had gone ahead of her to prepare the way for her selection. And in the midst of all her competitors, Esther who was a mere slave girl was put in a class of her own; a divine class. She was favoured. The Bible records that: “...Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai, who had charge of the women...” (Esther 2:8). |Divine partiality for Esther started with Hegai; the Bible says that “Hegai liked Esther and took a special interest in her. Right off, he started her beauty treatments, ordered special food, assigned her seven personal maids from the palace, and put her and her maids in the best rooms in the harem. Esther didn't say anything about her family and racial background because Mordecai had told her not to (Esther 2:9-10). Esther did not ask or lobby for this favouritism, but divinity arranged all for her by mercy. After the order of Esther, I decree that the word of God in Isaiah 54:7 that “For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee” shall begin to operate for us in Jesus name. No matter your unqualified status, no matter the politicking, today the Voice of God's mercy shall be heard in your favour in Jesus name."

      "message": "Preceding the Bible Text above, we see in Genesis 18:17, after the two Angels from God had delivered the message of Sarah having a child in a year's time for which Sarah laughed considering her age, God then said that He will not hide from Abraham the next thing He (God) was going to do regarding Sodom. God then revealed His intention to destroy Sodom because the terrible accusations against Sodom and Gomorrah, and their sin were so great. Abraham then approached God and questioned if God was going to destroy the innocent with the guilty. (Vs. 18-23 GNB). And as the said two Angels went towards Sodom, Abraham started to negotiate numbers with God from 50 until it got to 10. |Then in chapter 19, the Angels had an encounter with the perverse men that wanted to sleep with them, not knowing that the men were actually Angels, but which Lot prevented, offering those perverse men his own virgin daughters instead. Thereafter the Angels said to Lot that God had sent them to destroy Sodom because of their terrible sin. (19:13). And in verse 15, the Bible reveals that the Angels tried to make Lot hurry and said to Lot, “Quick! Take your wife and your two daughters and get out, so that you will not lose your lives when the city is destroyed.” (GNB). However, what do we see Lot do? He hesitated. |This sometimes is the attitude of man till today; unnecessary or sometimes very foolish hesitation. When one is warned that danger is coming, and yet they drag their feet in taking necessary action. These had often led to dastardly results as it would have to Lot and His family but for mercy of God. If we cast our minds back to the start of the virus in 2019 before it became a pandemic in 2020, one of the things that the scientists said was that the virus infection would not have spread so fast to all the nations of the world to become pandemic if Governments of different nations did not hesitate to take action. Hesitation can destroy or even rob one of blessings. |Brethren, have you been hesitant in your life and now fast with the result of your hesitation. Mercy is still available. The help of God will come to you by mercy as this was what saved Lot and his two daughters. The Bible says that when Lot failed to take instant action despite the warning, but rather hesitated: “...The LORD, however, had pity on him; so the men took him, his wife, and his two daughters by the hand and led them out of the city.” (Vs.16 GNB). The Lord will have mercy, on us and deliver us from every injury or dangerous situations we have put ourselves due to foolish hesitation in Jesus name. |The Word of God says: “...I will have mercy on anyone I wish; I will take pity on anyone I wish.” So then, everything depends, not on what human beings want or do, but only on God's mercy.” (Romans 9:15-16 GNB). Mercy of God will speak for us and our loved ones in Jesus name. |The truth of the mercy of God is not dependent on anything we do or fail to do; and not also dependent on our weakness can also be seen in the story of the widow of Nain in Luke 7:11-15. The Bible says that |Jesus arrived at the gate of the town called Nain and there was, a funeral procession of the death of the only son of a widow. And that when Jesus saw her, his heart was filled with compassion for her. Jesus then said to her, “Don't cry.” And he walked to the coffin, touched it, and said to the dead son, “Young man! Get up” and the dead son came back to life and Jesus gave him back to his mother. |This was a completely hopeless and helpless situation. The son was already dead. The woman was no longer asking for help. She didn't even notice Jesus. The disciples did not ask Jesus to help. It was just Mercy that came to her. This means that even in the most helpless and hopeless situation, the mercy of God can show up and change the narratives. May the mercy of God come to us and our loved ones in Jesus name. |Brethren, just as God's word says, His mercy is not dependent on man. God's mercy is God Himself. No matter the foolishness of man in hesitation and not acting promptly even in the face of danger, no matter the hopeless and helpless situation which you think can never change, when the mercy of God shows up; your story will changed. Therefore, if you will not ask for anything, let us learn to ask for the operation of the mercy of God in our lives and the lives of our loved ones. Mercy of God will overcome every weakness, helplessness and hopelessness in our lives in Jesus name. Amen."

It is not always good to say everything is all right, because truly it is not. People are hurting. |In the John chapter 11, Martha was expressing those feelings of grief on that day. And today, we might also be saying, “If only.” If only someone had done something different. If only he had had gotten treatment earlier. If only I had …… If only God had ….. But brethren, we cannot live in a world filled with only “if only”. We need to live in a world of reality. |The world of reality is one where bad stuff happens to good people. It is a world where good people get sick or have an accident and they die. Sometimes good comes and sometimes bad comes; that is the world we live in. It is the process we call life. Just recently, innocent students who went to University to build a glorious future for themselves were slaughtered like chicken by some elements who themselves have no future. Parents who had hopes of bright future for their children were suddenly thrown into mourning by some elements whose parents probably did not care if they live or not. These are the reality of our time. |There are times we hope and pray that God would break in – “If only God would …” yet sometimes He doesn't change the order of things and we get hurt. |But thanks to God that we are never abandoned by God in our sorrowful state. Jesus did not leave Martha without hope. He gave her this promise. “Your brother will rise again. Your brother will live again. Your brother will be with you again.” I believe that the thought might have brought a faint smile to her tear stained face. |Thinking of a day – somewhere in the future where there will be no more pain, no more sorrow, no more disease should bring a smile to all of our faces. To think of a day when every tear we have ever shed will be dried up and forgotten – should bring us some peace. To think of a day when those who are friends of God will live again should bring hope to our hearts; even on a day like today. |Today, as believers, we can trust in Christ. Today we can believe His promise that: \"Whoever believes in me, though he dies, yet shall he live. Everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die\"(John 11:26). |Both we and the people perpetrating evil will all come to the end of life. We all will face death at some point. Yet, Jesus' words will never change. “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live. Do you believe this?” If we believe, we have hope. If we believe, we have eternal life. |My brethren, I urge you today to be an encouragement to those that are hurting one way or the other due to loss of a loved one or are hurting because their loved one is still missing. Let us hold them up in our prayers. Ask Him to give you and them the comfort and peace that nothing can toil with even in times like this. May the peace of God be with us all. Let us find Jesus in time like this."

      "message": "When something is said to be sure or surely, it means the thing is secured, assured, firm or confidently unchangeable. The Psalmist pointedly tells of the unshakeable goodness of God following him. In Jeremiah 32:40, Prophet Jeremiah reveals the mind of God as it concerns the assuredness of His goodness wherein the Almighty God says: “...I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good for them...”(NLT). This is God Himself giving His Word. And in Isaiah 55:11, the Almighty God says that the word that goes out from His mouth shall not return to Him empty, but it shall accomplish that which He purposed, and that it shall succeed in the thing for which He (God) sent it. |It is this assurance of y mercy of God that king David is also confident of when says: “Surely...”. In other words, nothing can stop us from His mercy following us, except the one that decides to fall out of line. But even at that, the moment there is repentance, mercy draws the person back into God's favour. |What is Mercy? It is the covenant word which in the scriptures is also referred to as 'steadfast love' of God. The Psalmist therefore says that we can count on the mercy (steadfast love of God) together with the goodness (kindness) of God. Brethren, when the Lord is our shepherd, we have these twin guardian angels (goodness and mercy) always with us at our backs and our beck and calls. |As children of God, we are Princes and Princesses - Royalties. Hence the scripture says we are Royal Priesthoods and Peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9). Therefore, just as Princes and Princesses of earthly great kingdoms do not travel unattended to by maids and servants, so it is with us as believers. Mercy and goodness of God are the two angels following us and attending to us every second of our lives. |The Psalmist concludes by saying that he will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. This is also an assurance that as children of God and believers, when the Lord is our shepherd, we would enjoy the presence of the Lord forever i.e. here on earth and hereafter. Moses said to the Lord: “If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here” (Exodus 33:15). Moses understood that the presence of God is all that a man needs to excel in life. And God responded that: “...This very thing that you have spoken I will do...\" (Exodus 33:17). The same promise is for us, because we have found favour in God through Jesus Christ. |Charles Spurgeon, the great Baptist Preacher says of Psalm 23:5b that: “While I am here I will be a child at home with my God; the whole world shall be His house to me; and when I ascend into the upper chamber, I shall not change my company, nor even change the house; I shall only go to dwell in the upper storey of the house of the Lord for ever.” In other words, in the presence of God here on earth and also hereafter, we will continue to enjoy the presence of God. What a great privilege to have God as our shepherd. |Brethren, Psalm 23 is an encompassing prayer for our spirit, soul and body. It is a prayer that covers both the physical and spiritual needs of a man. It is a prayer that takes care of us while on earth and gives us an assurance that our hereafter is already taken care of. I pray the totality of Psalm 23 shall be manifested in our lives and in the lives of all our loved ones in Jesus name. Amen."

I pitch my tent with those who like pleasant surprises. God surprises His people every day. |What is a surprise? The dictionary defines it as: “an unexpected or astonishing event, fact...\" |One of the ways in which God surprises us is the record of Moses and the burning bush as seen in our text today. The unusual or unexpected thing was that the bush burned but it was not consumed. This indeed was a big surprise and it was beyond Moses' comprehension. |There are examples in the Scriptures of how God surprised His children. Moses was surprised, and so he said to himself in verse 3, “I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.\" And as he moved closer to see the wonders, another surprise unfolded as recorded in verse 4 that: God called unto Moses out of the midst of the bush, saying: Moses! Moses!! |Imagine you are watching something with amazement, still wondering how can this be, and suddenly you hear your name being called out from the midst of the unusual thing. I believe anyone would almost jump out of his\/her skin; and I believe that Moses couldn't have been any different. No one had ever seen such a sight; neither had Moses, before that fateful day. In the same vein, God also surprised Abraham and Sarah with the birth of Isaac at an age which was past child bearing for any woman. There are also other surprises in the New Testament, starting with the declaration that the Angel made to Mary, the mother of Jesus - “The Virgin Mary to bear a child.” At the tomb of Lazarus; Mary had given up hope. It was a forgone conclusion. Lazarus had been dead for 4 days; but when Jesus appeared, everyone there, and even those that later heard were surprised as recorded in John chapter 11. |Going back to the Old Testament; when the children of Israel got to the Red Sea; they most certainly have concluded that the end had come for them, since there is no record that they had ever had the opportunity to swim in their lives. They had been in slavery for over 400 years, and swimming exercise was not recorded in the Bible as being part of their curriculum or activities. But the God of surprises showed Himself mighty: “Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided” (Exodus 14:21). The Almighty God said to Moses, “...the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD...” (Exodus 14:18). I pray for you that whatever may be your situation, your adversaries will know that the Lord is God in your life in Jesus name. |God surprised the people of old and gave them outstanding victories. He is still the same unchangeable God. His love for you has not diminished from the love with which He loved the children of Israel. His word says, that because we belong to Jesus Christ, we are joint heirs according to His promises (Galatians 3:29). |Today, I rejoice with you for the pleasant surprises coming your way in every area that you have been looking unto God for His intervention in Jesus name. God will prove Himself mighty to surprise you. Your enemy will be shocked when His glory manifests in your life in Jesus name. God will surprise you."

Just imagine what the looks on your face will be like the moment the thing is handed into your hands. Sure, your face will reveal joy mixed with peace and love for the person. |Let us consider the story of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1:9-10, Hannah got up from her husband who could not give her the comfort of a child and she went into the presence of God and prayed like she has never done before. She poured her heart at the feet of the Lord. God did did not ignore Hannah. Because as far as it is with God, 'their faces shall never be ashamed!' God blessed Hannah with not only prophet Samuel but also 5 more children – “Hannah conceived and bore three sons and two daughters.” (1 Samuel 2:21). How Radiant would Hannah's face have been looking at her six children? I believe it would have been this kind passionate looks of: 'Lord, I will never take my eyes off You' looks or “I love you more than anything Lord” looks. Just like king David wrote: “I long for you like a deer that pants for water…..\" The look that is glowing with the beauty of God. Brethren, your face shall be radiant in Jesus name. |Brethren, are you calling on God  concerning a matter, an issue or a need. Try fixing your looks on God with passionate love, knowing beyond any doubt that He can never fail you. Because, God cannot resist such looks of love. Never! He would incline His ears to listen to you, just as He has promised. His love for you is  massive and immeasurable. No one but God gave their blood and life for you. And so He will give you that which you are looking to Him for. See (Romans 8:32) Try looking at God and trusting Him like when baby birds look at their mother bird for food with beaks open and looking only at their mother. Look only at God. He would not ignore you. |Praise be to Jesus for super love of God that gives God's children everything - victory, deliverance, achievement, provision, success's and everything. Show your love for God and trust in Him through your praying throughout the night and praising Him even though your answers are yet to arrive. That is the show of your trust and God honours it. |Brethren, what king David wrote in our text today that their faces were not ashamed is repeated in Paul's letter in Romans 10:11 that: “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” (NIV). Just as David said that  ”Those who look to Him are radiant”, that is how your eyes will brighten with joy and your face glowing when your victory, deliverance, breakthrough, favour, justification and success come. |Trust Him!

Uncle Laban deceived his nephew Jacob into Marrying Lea instead of Rachael, etc. |Judah slept with his daughter-in-law, Tamar. Samson was betrayed by the trusted love of his life, Delilah and thereby lost his life and destiny. Prophet Eli's Children defied the temple. King Saul envied little shepherd-boy, David and made frantic efforts to kill him. King David also killed Uriah because of Uriah's wife. Jezebel encouraged King Ahab to kill Naboth because of his vineyard. Judas Iscariot followed our Lord Jesus for three years, and yet, at the end he sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Peter, the rock, denied Jesus. The list is endless and it will continue until the world ends. |The word of God also tells us that:  \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?\" (Jeremiah 17:9). But, in the midst of all these,  we are not hopeless. And we can turn to such scriptures as Psalm 91 that says: \"he that dwells in the secret place of the Most High...\" It is only God that we can totally trust and solely rest on. And we know that His secret place is His word. In the midsts of all the dangerous, deceitful and wicked people, we have to dwell daily in His word and live by His word. This is however not for everyone but only those that believe in Him and have acknowledged Jesus. |Jesus is the word and He alone is our security. The scripture makes us to know this in the book of John that: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:1 &14). So, Jesus is the Word. |Brethren if we are in Christ, there is no fear because we have the God that is God of His word. The Psalmist declares that “Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God” (Psalms 20:7 ASV). To exhibit our trusting in God, we need to study His word with passion and know it for us to be able to use it in time of problems or dangers. People who rely on charms do not joke with their incantations, they take time to know it by heart so that when confronted with dangerous situations they are quick to start all their incantations. They use with passion that which cannot save. |As Christians, the situation around us is even more dangerous because we are also fighting unseen battles. But, we can rely on the promises of God in the midst of all the evils of this world that: \"a thousand will fall at our side and ten thousand at our right hand, it will not come near us...\". But, we need to spend time with His word so that we know His word by heart and be able to use it against every attack and scheme of the enemy. A child of God that lives without the word is like one trying to get out of an aircraft in the air without a parachute. We shall not become casualties or preys for the agents of the enemy in this wicked world in Jesus name. Therefore, dwell in God's secret place by dwelling in His word and remain under His cover."

      "message": "Disappointments often lead to hopelessness and discouragement. But, some disappointments can be blessings in disguise. However, more often than not, disappointments are orchestrated by evil forces against the children of God. However, no matter what powers may be behind your challenges or disappointments, God always has a way of turning every evil orchestration of the enemies  to the blessings of His children. But, we need to call on God. We need to learn to provoke God to remember us. |When you have a great prophecy over your life and it does not seem to be coming to anything near materialisation, there is no need to complain or mourn. But, rather go into the realm of fervent prayers to provoke God to remember you. Do not begin to doubt the word of God through prophecy. But, provoke God by asking him to remember you and reconsider you. |The story of Hezekiah, King of Judah, in 2 Kings 20:3 was typical example. King Hezekiah was not only sick, but Isaiah has come to reveal to him that death was going to be the end result of his illness. The Bible says that Hezekiah turned to God and prayed saying: “...LORD, please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.\" And God remembered Hezekiah and sent word back to him in vs. 5 that: \"...have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will heal you...” |Brethren, you need to provoke God concerning that which you have done for Him and in His name. This is what King Hezekiah did for God to remember him. Moses also in Exodus 32:11 provoked God concerning His Own power. The Bible says: But Moses implored God and said, \"O LORD, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? That is calling God to remember what He has done in the past. Prophet Elijah in 2 Kings 1:10 also provoked God when he was confronted by p |messengers of king Ahab: But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, \"If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you...”. Elijah called God to remember that he is a man of God. The result was fire instantly coming down from heaven and consumed the captain and his fifty men. One of the thieves on the Cross also called Jesus to remember him in His Father's kingdom in Luke 23:42. Before this thief called for remembrance, he had done something, as we see in verse 40 where he rebuked the other thief that was mocking Jesus. So, in effect, the thief provoked Jesus to remember that he spoke well of Jesus. That he did not mock Him. |You too can provoke the Lord to remember all that  you have been doing. Tell God as the people of Malachi did that you should not live a life of reproach. You can provoke God for your provision when you remind God that you have been doing His word in Malachi 3:9-12 and the enemy has no right over your finances. Gideon also provoked God in Judges 6:12-14 |Brethren, what is that situation that needs to change about you or your loved ones? What is that blessing that you have long been praying for and there has been an ungodly delay? What is the issue that the enemy intends to use to bring shame to you as a child of God? Rise up today and provoke God to remember you. There is one thing that you have done for God or in the name of God, He will remember it and hear you. Remember that God does not owe anybody. Proverb 6:10 says that: “...God is not unjust so as to overlook your work...”. God will remember you today."

      "message": "Apostle Paul in the above scripture reminds us of the victory which believers have through Jesus Christ. In other words, our victory is not an ordinary victory. In fact, our victory is not a product of our will, goodness, ability or capability; rather, it is the victory through the only victorious One, Jesus Christ. It is victory over death, it is victory every issue of life, it is victory over any kind of challenge and all the schemes of Satan. In 1 John 5:4, Apostle Paul's writing says: “For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world; our faith.” The Faith refers to is our faith in God through Christ. No matter what the enemy presents as a problem; no matter how recalcitrant the problem makes itself to look. The main equation is where your faith lies for victory. If your faith is in none other but Christ; then, congratulations, you are already an overcomer waiting to be announced for God's glory. |Romans 8:37 says: “No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.” Your faith for victory through Christ must however be backed up by your acknowledgment of your sin, confessing it to God, repentance and penitence before God if your challenge is as a result of a sin or wrong doing. The Psalmist says: “If I had ignored my sins, the Lord would not have listened to me.” (Psalms 66:18 GNB). Also, in Romans 6:1, Apostle Paul wrote that we cannot continue in sin, that grace may abound. Therefore don't truncate your faith by trying to hide your sin. Nothing is hidden from God (Psalm 139:7-12). But He wants us to confess it to Him (See 1John 1:8-10). |If you believe it is the power of the enemy in operation, like it was with Mordecai, you faith must be backed up by fervent prayer and His word, confessing the word of God over the situation. In the book of Esther, the Queen realised that the battle of Mordecai was not ordinary, but a battle against the Jews, so, Queen Esther declared a fast - Esther 4:16. |If your challenge is due to human envy or hatred, because you won't compromise the word of God to please men, back your faith up with standing on whatever the word of God says. In the book of Daniel, the three Hebrew boys would rather die than compromise the word. They said: “But even if he doesn't, Your Majesty may be sure that we will not worship your god, and we will not bow down to the gold statue that you have set up.”(Daniel 3:18 GNB). They were resolute on the commandment of God that says they (and we) must not bow to any other gods - Genesis 20:3&5. This strengthened their faith and they came out victorious. God has promised that no matter what we pass through, He will see us through. No matter what our circumstances may be, God already has it planned out to give us victory, hence He said when we pass through water or fire, He is with us. The water will not swallow us and the fire will not burn us (Isaiah 43:2). Not just the promises in the Old Testament, but God also gave Jesus Christ through whom we have a new covenant. God sacrificed Jesus for our sins, our healing and our victory. Jesus' coming to the world was not only for us to make heaven, but for us to also have victory on earth. This is why Jesus' word is: “...I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you” (Luke 10:19). |Jesus also made promise of abundant life in John 10:10b. To have abundant life includes abundance of peace, abundance of joy and abundance of resources and victories upon victories. |Today, Brethren, no matter what the battles may be, we can in faith walk shoulders high and heads up because we already have victory through Christ. He alone overcame Satan and He alone is the Prince of peace."

      "message": "One of the benefits or blessings of the presence of God being with man is protection. |The word 'protect' is a verb word which means to “fortify or to provide a place with defensive works as protection against attack.\" Protection also means shielding or to shelter, to preserve, to keep safe, to safeguard to security, or to provide refuge. By the Dictionary, it also means being immuned to danger. All these definitions gives one a deeper sense and understanding of what the presence of God does for the believer. Little wonder, King David wrote in Psalm 23 that:”Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me...” (Psalms 23:4 ASV). The Presence of God is therefore an unfailing assurance of protection from all evils. King David also revealed in Psalm 91:4&7 that \"For He will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease. Though a thousand fall at your side, though ten thousand are dying around you, these evils will not touch you.” (AMP). What a mighty God we serve. |Thousands of years ago, the Almighty God made great promises to a man of faith and an obedient servant of God by name Abraham that He (God) will give him wealth, blessings, greatness and protection (Genesis 12:2-3; 14:18-20; 22:17-18). And these are what all Abraham enjoyed. (See Genesis 24, 26-28, 35, 48; Numbers 24; Deuteronomy 1, 7-8, 11, 15-16, 28, 30, 33). As such up till our generation, Israel has never been overcome by any nation of the world. Yes, there were times in the Bible records that their enemies gained upper hands. But these only happened when Israel or Judah fell into sin. But even when that happened, God would in the end deal with the enemies; once the children of Israel repented and turned back to Him. The Almighty God is still the same God today. |Although, we are not geographically the Israelites, but by reason of Jesus' redemptive work, we have become adopted children of God and so, we are the spiritual Israelites. And so, by adoption and through the divine covenant of the blood of Jesus, we also have God's presence the moment we acceptsl Jesus as our Lord and Saviour. Hence, the scripture says: “And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to the promise”. (Galatians 3:29). |Brethren, God's presence is an assurance of safety, no matter the dangers around you. He has assigned ministering angels to His children and their households. All you need to do is to be sure that that you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. Be circumspect in all that you do because Jesus, Your Master says to you \"watch and pray.” (Matthew 26:41). Also, you must daily send these angels in the name of Jesus to continually minister the protection of God on you and your entire household. Psalm 91:11 says: “For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways”. (AMP) |As long as man does not depart from the presence of God like Jonah did as recorded in Jonah 1:3, God never departs from you and He will keep the promise of His presence and divine protection. May you or any of your loved ones never depart from the Presence of God in Jesus name. |In the midst of all the insecurity in our country and the world at large, God remains faithful. His presence and power of protection through the blood of Jesus shall keep you safe. The Lord is on your side, if He did not leave David as a shepherd boy and as a king, as prey to the teeth of the enemies as declared by David in Psalm 124:6; He will never leave you as prey to the enemies in Jesus name. Therefore, in this new week and beyond, His divine presence will give you and all your loved ones His divine coverage and protection from physical and or spiritual attacks in Jesus' mighty name."

      "message": "The promises of God all through the Bible are so numerous and you only need to find them in the scriptures and claim each of them. They are the promises of what God has already put in place for us. Jesus said when it comes to receiving what you ask in prayer, it is already yours but you have to believe. Hence Apostle Paul in his letter to the Christians in Ephesus said: “God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing.” (Ephesians 1:3). And to the Colossians he wrote that “God has made us worthy.” (Colossians 1:12). To the Romans he also wrote in Romans 8:32 that, God, who did not even keep back His own Son, but offered Him for us will also freely give us all things. (GNB). And when it comes to Godly living, Almighty God gives us all we need to attain it as written in 2 Peter 1:3 that: “God's divine power has given us everything we need to live a truly religious life through our knowledge of the one who called us to share in his own glory and goodness.”(GNB) |Therefore, going by the Scriptures, God has already positioned us to receive everything: be it physical, material or spiritual. There is also mercy for any mistake or error we would ever make. God already took care of it. He paid the ultimate price through the death, burial and resurrection of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; so that, as far as God is concerned, He has done His part. Now, it is up to us to do our part. And what do we do? Jesus said: “So do not start worrying: 'Where will my food come from? or my drink? or my clothes? Your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. Instead, be concerned above everything else with the Kingdom of God and with what he requires of you, and he will provide you with all these other things.” (Matthew 6:31-33 GNB). Once this part of the equation is done, all you need to do is to work and walk in faith. Because the scripture also says in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 that: “...The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.\". But God will multiply and bless the work of our hands (Deuteronomy 28:12). He will also prosper the works of our hands (Deuteronomy 30:9). |Therefore, as far as receiving everything good in life is concerned, God already positioned His children to receive. You already have it; yours is to walk in it by aligning yourself with His word; believe Him and keep thanking Him. Open your heart in faith today and believe His word over what you need. Trust Him and keep claiming the word and thanking Him. The Psalmist knows this hence he also made us to know that: “...The LORD is our protector and glorious king, blessing us with kindness and honour. He does not refuse any good thing to those who do what is right.” (Psalms 84:11 GNB). So, if what you are desiring is a good thing and you do what is right; you are in the position He placed you to receive and you will certainly have it. So, keep thanking Him in faith. You are positioned to receive from Him, hallelujah!"

      "message": "As believers we know the power of worship. To worship God is to show a lot of love and adoration for Him. When you truly worship God, you express what is your love for Him. Your worship is a kind of unquestioning devotion, this is why you move the hands of God faster when you praise and worship Him. In your worship, you create a platform for God's presence. In fact, His Word says God is looking for worshippers who will worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:23) |Worship is therefore another area that believers can draw strength in God. You do this by worshipping Him all through to your victory.  In Exodus 15:2 it is written: “The Lord is my strength and my song; He has given me victory. This is my God, and I will praise Him, my father's God, and I will exalt him”. Worshipping and singing praises to God in the midst of your struggles is a great source of strength in God. In our text today, taken from the story of Jehoshaphat and how the Israelites employed singing praises to God  to conquer the three nations of Moabitites, Amorites and the People of Mt. Seir. With praise and worship, we disarm our enemies and overcome our challenges. |It is often said that music has a kind of terrific power. Singing can touch people's hearts in ways that nothing else can. As such, when we we combine the power of worship with the power of prayer, we will have fantastic results. Anytime you are going through challenges and struggles, merely listening to choruses and hymns of praise and worship will restore your soul and give you new strength. King David in Psalms says that- “I will praise you, my defender. My refuge is God, the God who loves me.” (Psalm 59:17 GNB). |Let us consider the way that the psalmist combines praising God with God being his Defender. Apparently, he is receiving strength in the midst of singing praises to God because when God is your defender your victory is sure. It is important for us to spend quality time singing to God as between you and God. The Psalmist says that God is holy, “Enthroned in the praises of Israel.” (Psalms 22:3 NKJV). We also must enthrone God in our lives and over our situations through praising and worshiping Him. And when we do, we will draw in Him, the strength that we need to overcome every difficulty. God's hands are moved through our Worship. Therefore, draw strength from God through your worship of Him. Hallelujah!"

This is what prayer does. It's like when a child needs something, the child cries to his\/her parent; and the moment the parent says okay, I will give you, there is a kind of peace that comes on the child. |In Jeremiah 33:3, God says: “Call unto me, and I will answer you...” It is as simple as that. We all can remember our school days particularly if you happened to be a boarding student. Our parents have told us to call or write letter when we needed anything. If you needed something and you didn't call or write, it would be your fault. Even though God knows our needs, but He says, “call on me”. Jesus said in Matthew 7:7 that “Ask and you shall receive” |We also need to learn to increase the time we spend on our knees in prayer. The hour of prayer is the moment of drawing strength from God in prayer. Allocate more time to worship God even without asking for anything from Him. It will strengthen you in your journeys of life. |In extending hours of prayer, we also need to spend part of the time listening to whatever God has to tell us. When we do, God's Spirit will minister to our spirit and we will hear and understand Him. This is why Jesus says that His sheep (we) hear His voice, and He knows them (us), and that we will follow Him (John 10:27). When you take time to listen, you will hear God speaks to you. Prayer is a two-way communication with God. Not only do we need to speak to God but God also desires to speak to us as well. |Whenever we have gotten to the end of our ropes and feel like one cannot go on anymore, you will realise that it is because we had allowed other things to get in the way of our communication with God. We concentrated more on the situation than on God. |Brethren, your prayer life is part of the tool with which you can draw strength from God.

This is simply because challenge is a part of life. Hence today's scripture says that every test that you have experienced is the kind that normally comes to people. So, there is no new challenge coming to you that someone has not experienced and God will not allow you to be tested beyond your power. |One basic fact about challenges is that it can come from any area of a man's life. In other words, challenges can be personal, marital, educational, work place, relationship, financial or career. It can even be challenges with children, etc. So, no one is immuned to challenges. They will come at some point in one's life. Another fact is that there is no end to facing challenges until a man breathes his last breath. This is why there is no end to praying until the life of man ends. |How do we overcome challenges? We overcome when we connect with God. Therefore, anyone that connects with God will not be overcomed by challenges. Rather than being overcomed, the challenges become the tests that will eventually turn to testimonies. |Every human being faces challenges on daily basis; hence today's text says that with every test, God will give you the strength to endure it, and also provide you with a way out. God's word also says in Romans 8:37 that: “No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us”. |There is however no gainsaying that challenges can really overwhelm one. But when you draw strength from God, you can go through all the challenges and come out victoriously without you breaking down or your loved ones becoming destroyed or damaged along the way or as a result of any negative actions on your part. Example of this is the story Samson in Judges 16:23-31. Samson had challenges but it was not  because of his challenge that he failed but he failed because he did not draw strength from God in his time of challenge. Samson not only got damaged but he also destroyed a whole set of people. |Another example is Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. These four Hebrew boys had challenges but because they drew strength from God none of them was destroyed or damaged. In fact, they ended up drawing the king and the nation to the Almighty God. See the Book of Daniel chapters 3 and 6. God is always glorified when we hold unto Him all through our challenges. |The Children of Israel had diverse challenges while in Egypt. They also had challenges as they journeyed out of Egypt to the promised land. By reason of how they respectively drew strength from their God during all the challenges only the two people (Joshua and Caleb) absolutely trusted God and drew strength from Him and those that were children got to the promised land. All the others who did not connect to drawing strength from God did not get there. (See Numbers 14:20-24). May we all get to our promised land in Jesus name. |The only source of strength for man to go through challenges in life and come out victorious is the Almighty God. However, we have a role to play to draw the strength from God. This is why some have come out victorious while some have not, but became casualties. You will not become a casualty of the challenges of life in Jesus name. |Scripturally, there are Ways by which we can find strength in God in times of challenges. One of such ways is our relationship with God through Jesus Christ. May we have the grace to draw strength in God when challenges come in Jesus name. Amen."

So, there are evidences around us as proofs that God answers prayer. But because most of these evidences are personal; many who think of “evidence” as the only person observable, measurable, and reproducible proofs cannot understand how faith people live by the notion that God answers prayers. The truth however is that God's answer to your prayers is not dependent on whether the godless man would believe it or not. |The text of today is Jesus' word, and this is the same thing that the Psalmist reveals that the Almighty God says i.e.“call on me and I will answer”(Psalm 50:15). God is God, and He is not dependent on anyone. If He says it, surely He will do it. But, the answer to the prayer of one who decides to pray would also depend on whether such a person believes in the ability of God to answer his\/her prayer. This is why the writer of the Book of Hebrews says: “...for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him\" (Hebrews 11:6). |If God says: “call on me...I will answer” and Jesus Christ also says: “Ask and you will receive”; brethren, it is a done deal. No matter what comes your way, all you need to do is to call on God, and wait for His answer. He will surely answer. Because He says: “My Word shall not return to me void,” in other words, His promise to answer cannot be in vain; it is sacrosanct and nothing can change it. This is why John in his letter explains that: “...whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep His commandments and do what pleases Him (1 John 3:22). That which pleases Him is your faith. Your faith is the proof that you know that He cannot lie, you know that He does not fail in His promises; you know that since He gave Jesus, there is nothing He wouldn't give. And so, Your Faith pleases Him and it brings forth your answer. (Romans 8:32) |In the scriptures, we read that Elijah prayed for fire from heaven and it came down (2 Kings 1:12), Hezekiah prayed for deliverance and He received it (2 Kings 19:19), the Apostles prayed for boldness and they were bolden (Acts 4:29). Even Gideon prayed to see signs and God showed him signs as recorded in Judges 6:33-40. All these examples were written by eyewitnesses to the events, they are therefore clear evidence of answered prayers. |Brethren, whatever you have been looking onto God for in the past year, trust Him, He has you on His agenda, because you dared to ask Him. He will surely do it. Remember that He is your creator and He knows the right time for everything to come your way with perfect peace attending it. So, in this victory month of fasting and prayer, be engaged in serious praying and keep trusting. God answers prayers. He will answer yours. Because you trusted God and waited on Him, the time for your favour is now (Psalms 102:13)."

      "message": "There are so many great and uncountable things that Mercy can do for man. Here are ten of them: |1. You will be preferred above others Genesis 25:23. |2. Mercy makes your life attractive. It is a magnetic force that adds attractiveness to everything you do. It draws the right kind of people to you. |3. Mercy singles you out of the crowd. |4. Mercy links your path with your helpers that will bless you and those that will assist you. Psalm 118:7 (KJV) \"am too blessed to be common.\" |5. Mercy commands supernatural favour. Mercy precedes favour. Favour will not come until they have mercy on you. |6. Mercy gives you access into places you ordinarily couldn't enter. |7. Mercy covers your errors – you will make mistakes but no one will notice it. May mercy overrule your errors. |7. Mercy prevails over deserved judgement James 2:13. There are people around you, called fault-finders. They publicise and announce your mistakes. They that wait for the day of your shame, they will be disappointed in Jesus name. |8. Mercy gives you divine settlement. Your parents can be there, but can't take you there; but God's Mercy will  take you to the levels beyond your imaginations. |9. Mercy silences your adversaries. |10. Mercy humiliates your adversaries. It makes them change their testimonies about you. What my enemies want me to be, I will disappoint them. |Therefore Brethren, if you must ask God for anything in the remaining days of this year, let mercy be the first after thanking Him for giving you Jesus. His Mercy will open to you today, the door that you have knocking for days, months or years in the mighty name of Jesus."
